# Privacy Notice

WAAN processes chat data locally on your device for analytics.

## What WAAN Processes

- Mirrored chat messages and metadata needed to compute analytics.
- Local app state such as selected chat, filters, and saved views.
- Optional relay status/log details for troubleshooting.

## Where Data Is Stored

- WAAN stores mirrored chats, cache files, and settings on your local machine
  (WAAN app data folders).
- WAAN does not upload your chat content to WAAN-operated servers by default.

## When Data Leaves Your Device

Data leaves your device only when you explicitly do so, such as:

- Exporting CSV/JSON/PDF/report files.
- Sharing logs or exported artifacts.
- Using external services you choose to connect separately.

## Third-Party Services

WAAN relies on WhatsApp Web and supporting libraries. Their infrastructure and
policies are controlled by their respective providers, including WhatsApp/Meta.

- WhatsApp Terms: `https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service`
- WhatsApp Business Terms (if applicable): `https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms`

## Data Safety Recommendations

- Use full-disk encryption and a protected OS account.
- Prefer a dedicated/secondary account for first-time setup.
- Restrict access to exported files and logs that may include sensitive content.
- Clear local mirrored data when needed using **Clear Cached Chats**.

## Project Relationship

WAAN is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
sponsored by WhatsApp/Meta.
