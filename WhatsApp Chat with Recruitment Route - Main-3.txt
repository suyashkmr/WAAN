07/05/24, 09:54 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Hey folks!
I've been chatting with fellow TA professional whom I know personally with an average experience of 4years (so is mine). All of us seem to be at the cross roads of choosing to stay in the same function or pick up a different function with transferable skills we already have.

For example I've been eyeing at product or program management.

Since we have professionals here with more than 5 years of experience, what made you all have the conviction to grow in the same function?
07/05/24, 09:56 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Aah I always wanted to get into prod management. The problem is transferable skill sets !! PM is a different ball game altogether! At best from what I see and know we best can transition to a sales role . Of course I am happy to be corrected :) 
You touched a nerve there mate 😄
07/05/24, 10:04 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Sitting through multiple Product assignment of different domains and challenges helped get a reality check on what the market demands from me if I need to transition.

My hypothesis is most people fear the reality check before putting down papers and skip the whole process of understanding their strengths and fitment
07/05/24, 10:04 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Also @⁨Arvindh Murthy HR⁩ did you give sales a shot?
07/05/24, 10:05 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: A friend of mine shifted to HR Tech project/ Program mgmt long back and he is continuing the same. I have seen profiles where HRs have moved onto HRTech related product development. It again depends on your strengths and where u want to be! Rest everything will fall in place

07/05/24, 11:20 - Mridusha Bhaduri Sr. TA Specialist: I approached a friend of mine and discussed my thoughts about career transition to a different role..so at to say for product management..however did not get a concrete response. I was told that a relevant degree from a good college matters..since I was thinking to take up courses but I was clueless which course would actually add value
07/05/24, 11:34 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: If your current org has a product team or needs an internal product to be built, pick that opportunity up.

I picked up a project to build a dashboard to manage 900 individual profiles of freelancers and project views for Producers. Took about 5 months to figure all the pain points and address, the more brutally honest your team is about the product the smarter you get.

11/05/24, 10:52 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Please use it and make your team’s and leadership’s life easier 🙌
11/05/24, 10:57 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: If someone has something for TA also pls share
11/05/24, 10:58 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Would be good to see
11/05/24, 11:20 - Chandni Jumani RR: Yes, please! It'll be helpful 🙏
11/05/24, 11:21 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: You mean performance metrics?
11/05/24, 11:21 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Or competencies
11/05/24, 11:21 - Chandni Jumani RR: Both would be great
11/05/24, 11:22 - Chandni Jumani RR: This is needed more :)
11/05/24, 11:44 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Both
11/05/24, 11:44 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Competencies more
11/05/24, 12:14 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: <Media omitted>
11/05/24, 12:15 - Chandni Jumani RR: Thank you so much 🙏🏼
11/05/24, 12:15 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: This was shared by @victor baba some 6-7 years back and I found it so close to my thinking that I still refer it many times 🥇
11/05/24, 12:19 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Victor ki jai 🙌🏽
11/05/24, 12:20 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: I think this will differ from different scale of organizations, and needs to be tailored based on the type of organization one is working for. 

The competency might change too, as this was 6-7 years back, and since then a lot of things have changed.
11/05/24, 12:21 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Absolutelely. But it's a framework everyone has got with Victor having put the effort. I think that's great. The power of sharing & free giving..
11/05/24, 12:21 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: <Media omitted>
11/05/24, 12:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: What has changed according to you?
11/05/24, 12:50 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Because for me, this is the best competency measure one can ask for. It showcases what things each level should OWN. And ownership is one of the biggest trait differences in TA
11/05/24, 12:51 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: From both skill and team perspective
11/05/24, 15:12 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: That's what I told, it needs to be tailor made. 

And 6-7 years back things would have been different, and now if you see these competency would change. I have seen in few orgs, where junior folks are already doing great stakeholder management, employee engagement and many other things which falls under the lead category, but can we give that title? Answer would be possibly no, even if the answer goes yes to some extent, will they be paid at that level, answer - definitely no. One of the junior folk I'm only mentoring, and she is doing amazingly good, and she is already coming to a lead "as per the framework shared", but she is not. 

I'm not saying it's bad, or not disrespecting the fact from wherever it is coming from. 

What I meant is these framework needs to be tailor made to suit org needs. And, to do some more research on current standards. There needs to be an intent. 

Yaha sab kuch change ho rha hai, tech standards are changing drastically, why not TA frameworks.
11/05/24, 15:31 - Abhishek Nadagowd TA Apollo.io: <Media omitted>
11/05/24, 16:20 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Agreed, Kunal! The frameworks and competencies need to be continually evolving. But the table was for TA (not engagement) and not from a role perspective but responsibilities and growth curve perspective. Roles & comps anyways don’t make sense in 95% startups (2 yr exp can be lead at 4L and 5yrs exp can be asst deputy manager at 40L without actually managing even an intern). 
All frameworks are generic by definition and hence need to be customised to our org’s solution.
11/05/24, 16:31 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: This is quite exhaustive and detailed!

14/05/24, 11:43 - Shamini Abraham Culture & Talent Headout: A friend launched an ATS-LinkedIn Integration product earlier this year. I have personally used it and love how it saves time. Would love for you to see if Talent Tick can be a good addition to your team. This is what he has to say - 

Talent Tick - SuperCharge your sourcing with ATS-LinkedIn Integration. 
1. It bridges the gap between your ATS and     LinkedIn 
2. Improves your sourcing productivity by leaps. 
3. Do not waste time: 
- switching between LinkedIn and your ATS, 
- checking if a profile exists in your ATS or not, 
- checking if someone from your team has already reached out to a candidate or not,
- downloading resumes from LinkedIn and uploading them to your ATS. 

TalentTick does it for you by showing the status and details of a candidate on their linkedin profile itself and also lets you add a profile directly from linkedin through a click of a button. 

Currently supports Greenhouse and Ashby, open to adding support for your ATS.

Watch a quick demo: https://youtu.be/CkWrmSwxx6c

14/05/24, 21:05 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Hi all, had a few questions to ask because we're trying to streamline our inbound hiring channel. Would love to understand your views on this. 

1. What are the hiring platforms you use for non tech mid to senior hiring and frontline sales hiring?
2. How do you solve the problems of receiving a lot of junk/irrelevant profiles in your inbound and how do you optimise for attracting more relevant profiles?
3. How do you sift through the inbound profiles? Do add a friction in process like a form to be filled or by linking the platform application and ATS which then auto sifts through these profiles? 
4. On an average, how many positions are closed by inbound applications?
14/05/24, 21:10 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: 1. LinkedIn
2. Add questionnaires to filter out irrelevant ones
3. Yes application form with few questions specifically on their experience, kind or clients and domain they worked for, their target achievement etc
4. Depends in last org we closed all roles in house out of which 60% got closed via inbound applications. For tech this number is lower
14/05/24, 21:12 - Shruti Goyal Associate Manager TA Aidetic: Hi all, had a few questions to ask because we're trying to streamline our inbound hiring channel. Would love to understand your views on this. 

1. What are the hiring platforms you use for non tech mid to senior hiring and frontline sales hiring? - the channels you can inticrate with your current ATS tool  - like LinkedIn, IIM jobs , Naukri portal and other job boards like indeed .
2. How do you solve the problems of receiving a lot of junk/irrelevant profiles in your inbound and how do you optimise for attracting more relevant profiles? 
It’s always to put a filter on your search profiles under every position that is posted through the ATS platform. Your life will become easy if you inticrate/direct all the profiles to one sourcing point. Now those candidates who don’t qualify those key skills set, put them to reject section and send the email to them.

3. How do you sift through the inbound profiles? Do add a friction in process like a form to be filled or by linking the platform application and ATS which then auto sifts through these profiles? 
Genrally we have a section of internal referrals, where the details of current employees and the referral’s email is shared. You can streamline it. 


4. On an average, how many positions are closed by inbound applications?
Depends on how actively you are working on it.
14/05/24, 21:17 - Jaya Bhardwaj Sr. TA Manager Vimeo: This is based on what has worked for me.

1. LinkedIn works best for non Tech roles, specifically for Sales hirings Mid to Sr. roles, you will find great talent and you can tap them fast with Premium access.
I have also used Indeed free version for this, though it sends some irrelevant ones too. So a bit time consuming if you are ready to spend time.
2. Filter works great in ATS like Greenhouse to weed out irrelevant profiles by creating rules while posting a Job. This can also be solved by sending a quick job form manually/automatically at an Application review stage.
3. The mandatory filter/ questionnaires helps manage pipeline effectively.
4. ⁠Generally quality of Inbounds are great if  you’ve good market reputation and great social media presence. 
We have got 70% success with inbounds last year.
14/05/24, 23:08 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: Specifically answer for point 2 -

We have a mandatory Google form step. First level of screening is done based on a few hygiene parameters like experience (years, industry, etc. if the role demands it), work location, etc. at the next stage we setup a 2-3 question form and only the folks who fill that are evaluated further. This form usually has one question that asks for a self recorded video to answer a specific question. This has worked best for us so far in terms of high intent leads and also quality. <This message was edited>
14/05/24, 23:15 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This message was deleted
14/05/24, 23:15 - Bharathi Vijayappa TA Uptycs: 1.Linkedin /Industry or domain specific exhibition list to map the target co's and source on linkedin or naukri
2.putting filters on ATS and posting jobs on skill specific groups or community can help you to attract right talent
3.asking them to fill a form by asking specific  question on skill or industry or tools
4.Iam not a big fan of inbound application.I have closed a very small no in my whole exp.Most of my experience is in SME's and startups.Iam a big fan of sourcing 😀
14/05/24, 23:26 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Very interesting question!!!

-What are the hiring platforms you use for non tech mid to senior hiring and frontline sales hiring?
* Linkedin, Naukri, Network, Employee referrals, Hirist, IIMJOBS, Good consultants who are good in sales hiring

-How do you solve the problems of receiving a lot of junk/irrelevant profiles in your inbound and how do you optimise for attracting more relevant profiles?
* One of the practices that we use is sharing few questions to be answered or an assessment or a case study depending on the role
* Positioning the Opportunity in relevant portals/communities - Check how and where target candidates are available.
* This is a process and it evolves after first week of application tracking for me

-How do you sift through the inbound profiles? Do add a friction in process like a form to be filled or by linking the platform application and ATS which then auto sifts through these profiles? 
- I would any day prefer to read profiles and make judgements than rely on keyword elimination. I don't want to miss even 1 good candidate just for a reason that he had not put up ATS friendly resume(only my personal way of working)

-On an average, how many positions are closed by inbound applications?
- Depends on how your company brand, opportunity positioning is attracting profiles!
15/05/24, 06:56 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: For everyone who suggested a case study , questionnaire unless it’s simple , how many of your candidates do really respond to that on time ? We hv case studies offline in nature for few roles after the first round still 50% or more either don’t respond or take a lot of time impacting TAT
15/05/24, 06:56 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Do you all face the same problem ?
15/05/24, 07:00 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Can someone answer question on hiring metrics? 
In a start up environment what’s the TAT , how many positions each recruiter per month  ( tech or non tech ) - considering direct sourcing, conversion ratios do you guys have as targets . Something that’s  achievable …
15/05/24, 07:17 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: We do have case study for product and marketing roles. Till case study everything goes well when it comes to that ,the ratio who attempts case study falls down to 40 to 50.%

We try to give the case study towards the end of the week (Thursday and ask them to submit on Monday ). However very few will submit on time others do it when they are done. 

Those kind of roles TAT will be hit , we can’t control once case study is given unless candidates is really interested in your organisation or seriously looking out for opportunities.

Other solution is keep building the pipeline strong if you know that only 30 to 40% is taking case study then make sure you give it to large number. If u want 10 case study submission then give it for 20 to 30 folks.

TAT/ positions per month: This depends on few things mentioned below 

1) selling the role rightly ,to right target audience. Get them excited about the opportunity you have 
2)you need a good branding ( a good brand attracts more applications ) which gives a better joining ratio.
 3) Which domain your product is.(I see candidates inclining towards fintech ,e-commerce products more ). Those companies are cash rich 🤑 in terms of valuations and salaries pay too.
15/05/24, 07:21 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah I work with Capillary 
Niche product and in B2B
15/05/24, 07:22 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: B2B challenges apply to us <This message was edited>
15/05/24, 07:23 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: But yeah I get the point issues are the same 😊 <This message was edited>
15/05/24, 07:23 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thanks Mani
15/05/24, 07:24 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: I'm currently working on a SPM role for one of the US based product startup
Where assignment will be shared at R3 or R4 level for presentation. 
And 90 to 100% are submitted that as they have already invested so much time in going through 2 to 3 discussions 😅
15/05/24, 07:26 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: You are lucky in that case 😊
And also the market , in US and UK I haven’t seen those challenges but in India
15/05/24, 07:26 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: The hiring is for India
15/05/24, 07:26 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah thn u r lucky 😊
Or doing something that is working for you in specific
15/05/24, 07:26 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Let us know 😊
15/05/24, 07:27 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Interesting!
15/05/24, 07:27 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Anyone can give examples of their hiring metrics ?
15/05/24, 07:27 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: I think one of the reason could be
After 2 or 3 rounds even candidates will get a lot of clarity about the role expectations/company
15/05/24, 07:28 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Got it
15/05/24, 07:28 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: We’ve started giving assignments as the 3rd step in the process. So like Priyanka mentioned, the candidate is quite invested in the process by this time and tend to complete it. 

Another thing that has worked for us is inviting candidates to office and telling them to take a whole day to finish all rounds at one go. So they get 2-3 hours to do the task in our office itself and then speak to our team member about their assignment and thought process behind it.
15/05/24, 07:28 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Got it 👍
15/05/24, 07:28 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thanks guys
15/05/24, 07:29 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: In person interviews are anytime better 
The case study we give needs 3-4 days as it’s heavy on documentation
15/05/24, 07:30 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: So for tech system designing n stuff we hv been calling folks to office but for other roles it is not possible
15/05/24, 07:30 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Let me try exploring giving after 2nd interview
15/05/24, 07:32 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I had 80% success with respect case studies for Product mgt roles. Case study was the first round and the next immediate round is based on the case study itself. So if someone has solved the case study well, in 99% of the case we have closed in offer.
Developers assignment yes 50% drop and we were ok with it. Yes TAT increases but that's something upto companies to decide on quality hire or time ! <This message was edited>
15/05/24, 07:34 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We are recently attempting code assignment through hacker earth which has improved the ratio, code assignments are a  challenge at mid to senior level. We used ask them share any piece of code , we used geektrust platform where code of the candidates are visible while selecting the profiles..
15/05/24, 07:36 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Case study / assignment: we used to let the candidate choose the timeline and that was one of the criteria , are they submitting on time, if not how are they handling us....few candidates had even sent optimised code after submitting the assignment!
15/05/24, 09:02 - Chandni Jumani RR: Hey Neha - we have an assignment/ case study as a part of each req (including interns) - it helps us understand them better 
However, we do get people who respond. I would say 1 in 10 don’t respond or have a valid reason for not being able to work on the assignment 

One of the things that we do is: As soon as they’ve booked a slot with us to speak, we send the interview process their way. 
This helps set the expectations 
And even during the conversations with them, we say our process may take time. This way they’re mentally prepared for what’s to come
15/05/24, 09:04 - Chandni Jumani RR: 2-3 reqs per recruiter. All 3 can’t be heavy weight reqs because that’ll require a lot of bandwidth and work
(2 can be heavy weight)

The TAT to close can vary based on the req and if that req goes through an iteration
Tentatively between 30-60 days <This message was edited>
15/05/24, 09:06 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thanks CJ
15/05/24, 09:27 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: Working in a fast paced start up environment, I single handedly take care of HRBP and TA for one of our group companies (120 headcount ) moreover help our other group company in hiring tech and product and few Non tech roles, currently I work on 23 positions ( No external vendor support ). We don’t have target and our TAT is 60 days. Sources: Naukri, LinkedIn, Instahyre, Bigshyft and Cutshort. <This message was edited>
15/05/24, 09:36 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: In a fast paced Startup, TAT for closures has to be less than 45 days. Each recruiter can manage 5-7 Requirements divided based on Priority for each role. P0, P1 and P2 (P0 being daily efforts required, P1 being every alternate day efforts required, P2 Is 2 - 3 hours of weekly efforts required to close). We have been doing this since last 3+ years and closing anywhere between 40-50 offers at an average each quarter. Highest feat achieved with same formula was 100+ offers and 90+ joiners with 4 recruiters without any vendor support. KRA's were set at team level as well as at individual levels too for each quarter.
15/05/24, 09:37 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This is very aggressive! What kind of people and level you hire on majority ?
15/05/24, 09:37 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: How helpful is bigshyft and cutshort
15/05/24, 09:38 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Havent used bigshyft
15/05/24, 09:38 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: These portals too will have limited supply! And yes it might work if you are giving them good money
15/05/24, 09:39 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Interesting what are their commercials ?
15/05/24, 09:39 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I have used bigshyft. Candidates expectations there is big money. If you are able to match it....check it out
15/05/24, 09:40 - Arvindh Murthy HR: App or web based application?
15/05/24, 09:40 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: This is not aggressive for a fast paced Startup. Level of candidates are 3+ years to leadership roles. Majority roles 5-10 years experience range. We had a good ATS and process in place. And a good mix of inbound and outbound closures. 30% tech roles 70% sales, bdr, CSM, PMs, Etc.
15/05/24, 09:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: More innovative hiring solutions are required If you are putting cost per hire, quality hire  as a serious metric
15/05/24, 09:41 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Tech and non tech roles?
15/05/24, 09:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This mostly tech and product mgmt that I have used for
15/05/24, 09:42 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Ya makes sense.  Closing tech roles keeping quality and cost in mind within 45 days is aggressive. This requires an ideal set up!
15/05/24, 09:42 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: 5-7 requirement is a very good number, currently we have 125 positions open and we got 6 recruiters.
15/05/24, 09:45 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yes and I need to know what’s an ideal set up hence that question or else it’s a burn out
15/05/24, 09:45 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: We have seen above 6-7 unique roles per recruiter the quality of efforts starts degrading hugely. Number of positions can be more for each unique role but the roles I try to keep limited to max 5-7 range depending on the complexity of the role.
15/05/24, 09:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Which ATS and how is ATS instrumental in this beyond helping with the process and ofcourse getting inbound profiles but in my opinion outbound works much faster- can you advise here ?
15/05/24, 09:49 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: How’s campus looking for you guys this year ?
15/05/24, 09:52 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Having a good ATS is very helpful. It helped alot in automation of multiple operational tasks, like weekly reporting, mailers, first level screening and rejection of irrelevant profiles. We used Freshteams which had good job portal posting options so it used to post on multiple channels like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc for free which gave us good  flow of inbound applications. Recruiters had a good view of where they are in terms of aging of roles. It also had good scheduling features. We also set expectations with our HMs in terms of weekly availability for interviews so that recruiters time can be saved and not go back and forth for availability.
15/05/24, 09:53 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Let’s talk more about it . I will call you if that’s ok sometime in the evening today or tomorrow
15/05/24, 09:53 - +65 9068 5421: This message was deleted
15/05/24, 09:54 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: We hire mostly interns for now and that too for only tech roles.
15/05/24, 09:54 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Sure.
15/05/24, 09:54 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: In my experience, bigshyft has good tech talent available
15/05/24, 09:56 - Chandni Jumani RR: Instahyre is good for tech talent too
15/05/24, 09:59 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Yess
Pretty good. 
Also, you can use it for individual roles for promoting a job by paying as little as 3K for a month and using their database also which is not available with a lot of platforms if we promote a single Jon.
The only thing is that they have 250 credits, which means we can view 250 resumes in a month, which I feel is sufficient to close 1 role.
15/05/24, 10:20 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: 1.⁠ ⁠What are the hiring platforms you use for non tech mid to senior hiring and frontline sales hiring? _LinkedIn mainly. Get contact details from Naukri if required. Had tried IIM jobs, folks are expensive. For niche requirements, I did a lot of outbound via LinkedIn as well._ 

2.⁠ ⁠How do you solve the problems of receiving a lot of junk/irrelevant profiles in your inbound and how do you optimise for attracting more relevant profiles? _Most people these days go with “rage applying”. So, haven’t been able to solve this issue. HMs sharing jobs in their network helps. If the role is niche, outbound is the way. Managing LinkedIn and ATS for outbound is a slight pain. Hardly 20-30% are screen shortlists._ 

3.⁠ ⁠How do you sift through the inbound profiles? Do add a friction in process like a form to be filled or by linking the platform application and ATS which then auto sifts through these profiles? _I have used Zoho and now Trackstar. None of them are good enough in weeding out irrelevant folks. So manual sifting. You can have a form/intro video like others suggested. It’ll only work for junior roles._

4.⁠ ⁠On an average, how many positions are closed by inbound applications? _50-70% on an average via inbounds, next best is employee referrals. Trying to move away from vendors._
15/05/24, 10:30 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hey everyone
Is Paytm laying off more folks? Has anyone heard anything?
15/05/24, 10:38 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: It's experimental! Keep experimenting!
15/05/24, 10:40 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Oops my favorite subject! Even for the most early stage startups and Bootstrapped companies who are my companies , I will first install ATS and then go ahead.  Selecting ATS is also a hurricane task given that there are so many products
15/05/24, 10:43 - Gunjan Das TA Head Attentive.ai: Why we need structured interview processes ?
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gunjan-das-081514b4_recruitment-hiring-talentacquisition-activity-7196376582398054402-ZRy3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
15/05/24, 11:03 - Mehvish K HR Head Travelwings: Someone asked about hiring metrics.

You could use:
1. Cost Per Hire  
2. Time to Start - The average time taken from when the position opens till a candidate is selected and joins. 
3. TIme to Productivity - The average time taken from when the position opens till they can match the level of productivity of an employee who's been in the system at a similar level. 
_The last two help you reverse calculate how early you need to start looking for candidates for planned hiring._
4. Screen to Offer - This is from the time a candidate is screened (in case of outbound search) till they are sent an offer. We try to keep this <7 working days. 

Most of our searches are indeed outbound, we search on LinkedIn, pick up numbers from Naukri. 

We use Zoho One, so Zoho People as an HRMS and Zoho Recruit as the ATS. 

The biggest advantage of an ATS which I find is having your own mini database. I remember speaking with the Bigshyft guys when they were quite new, and it's always good to ask who are you not good enough for 😅. They said Amazon is a pain, they already have profiles of every candidate we send them in their database. 

Which brings me to the other point this group is discussing, inbound applications are directly linked with your employer branding, if you are a recognisable brand in the industry, your inbound applications will be enough to close positions else outbound searches and recruitment vendor empanelment is what you'd need. Hope this helps. <This message was edited>

If we give late coming options does that work ?
15/05/24, 12:11 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: You can’t call them to office if state sends out a circular, but you can ask non-voters to start late virtually

15/05/24, 12:23 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Yess, product & Design communities will give you best dividends. Check creators of products (slack). Designers are intelligent bunch, won’t trust you easily unless you’re in the trenches helping them evaluate the market

16/05/24, 13:42 - +65 9068 5421: @⁨Neha Lakhwani Capillary⁩ hackathons help build an employer brand while you that helps you hire better talent. There will be some positions that can be closed but starting this requires thought and discipline as this showcases your employer brand and not doing it well does speaks volumes at the same time. 

A lot of planning and coordination is required to make this successful

16/05/24, 14:26 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Also hackathons don't work beyond 5 yrs experience....
16/05/24, 14:28 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: So I was talking to leaders here 
Ofcourse I understand that there needs to be a strong pull factor for the developer community, a reason that will attract them to register for hackathons which is beyond hiring 
That cause needs to be deliberated 
Some ideas that worked ? Any suggestions

16/05/24, 19:51 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Neha, I ran a meetup community in Pune for purely employer brand + quality hiring. Grew it to 2000+ folks over 6 months. We did an event every 3 weeks - tech talk on a solved problem, hackathon or yearly global day of code retreat (a worldwide event we registered and  hosted along 100s of other companies). 

Ops - Usually hosted by our architect, CTO from a partner company or insightful guest speakers from previous meets for lightning talks. Initially didn’t stream the event to make it feel exclusive. Started streaming on Twitter & YouTube when crowd started hitting capacity. 2 hrs max (except code retreat was 6 hrs)

Deets - Completely free, all registrations on meetup site or Google form, pizzas for lunch at closure. Budget would be 5-8k per event. On avg 60-80% would turn up. First 3-4 ones we only got about 10 folks to come. Eventually 6 months down the line, 50+ would come which was our limit as we had a small office.

Hiring - I made 3 SSE hires from these events + 1 architect on consultant contract.
16/05/24, 19:53 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I did this 6-7 years back. This would be way easier to do in today’s time + Bangalore’s active scene + new tools. <This message was edited>

16/05/24, 21:22 - Gokul Dhuraisaami HR TBC1: Tried, but no luck. Still getting profiles without resumes as well.
16/05/24, 21:30 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: Not everyone will upload resume in LinkedIn
16/05/24, 21:34 - Simar RR: LinkedIn does not typically allow public indexing of resumes attached to profiles. However, you can try to use some advanced Google search operators to locate LinkedIn profiles that might mention or link to a resume within their profile text.
16/05/24, 21:34 - Simar RR: You can try this one -

site:linkedin.com/in "resume attached" OR "link to my resume" and developer and india
16/05/24, 21:34 - Simar RR: Edit the Tech stack and location as per your requirement.
16/05/24, 21:39 - Gokul Dhuraisaami HR TBC1: Yes

16/05/24, 21:44 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Ohh sorry you want LinkedIn specific profiles. I thought you mentioned xray to get resumes. Yeah LinkedIn doesn't allow public indexing but yes use words that typically someone might add in their LinkedIn content, like @⁨Simar RR⁩ suggested.

23/05/24, 09:34 - You pinned a message
23/05/24, 09:36 - You changed the group description
23/05/24, 09:46 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: Lol, we were considering getting a Naukri subscription and they pitched this; so just wanted feedback. No reason per se.

Out of curiosity though, is it that bad?
23/05/24, 09:46 - You added Deepthi Chenjeri R Sr. Manager HRBP Pazcare
23/05/24, 09:48 - +91 99023 29420: They quoted 1k per user for us😱
23/05/24, 09:48 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: They kept pushing us to use same.... It seemed ok but quite costly. We didn't take it.
23/05/24, 09:49 - +91 99023 29420: Have any used Zoho recruit?  If yes, would you recommend?
23/05/24, 09:49 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: Loool. We still have to be frugal. 😀
23/05/24, 09:49 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: They gave you for free? For us they quoted 8L+taxes 😕
23/05/24, 09:50 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: How is Naukri subscription cost if anyone have renewed recently ?
23/05/24, 09:50 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: Noooooo. I would never recommend it. 

The UI is bad, and their reports make no sense half of the time.
23/05/24, 09:51 - +91 99023 29420: Thanks Prapti :)
23/05/24, 09:52 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Have used it and yes can recommend. Its a good tool for org size upto 200-300. Above that you should go with greenhouse, keka(if only operating in India), Pyjama HR, also now there are many AI powered ATS that you can try.
23/05/24, 09:53 - Suyash Kumar: How's SpringRecruit?
23/05/24, 09:53 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Didn't use it. Only took demo. Seemed ok.
23/05/24, 09:54 - Chandni Jumani RR: Did a demo. Didn’t feel it was great. 
Freshteam’s platform seemed better compared to theirs

So you can imagine how good or not good it was :) <This message was edited>
23/05/24, 09:56 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Freshteam we used for 2 years in my last org. It was a nearly perfect tool only issue was its referral process was pathetic. Also now its discontinued for new clients. Only open for current users
23/05/24, 09:56 - Chandni Jumani RR: That’s true 
We still have it but are figuring out which one next
23/05/24, 09:57 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Till you have it keep it. As no other platform you will get in that price anymore. We took demo of Skillate it looks promising but again little expensive
23/05/24, 10:09 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Heard Keka 's support is not good. And I was talking to them for  their ATS; in the end payment stage they turn down their entire proposal stating they don't give only ATS anymore and I have to take their entire HRMS product! Very unprofessional <This message was edited>
23/05/24, 10:10 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Yes they recently started pushing whole suite. We moved from Keka last year to Darwinbox. Their HRMS is ok and improving. ATS is bad.
23/05/24, 10:11 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Darwinbox requires huge investment and commitment for 3 long years!
23/05/24, 10:12 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: Agree, Darwinbox ATS is so basic, it’s almost equal to manual task and don’t have the flexibility to change any errors.
23/05/24, 10:12 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: My customers are either in early stage or Bootstrapped, so when I consult them and recommend on HR automations, I look for how flexible the product is, how easy/simple it is and budgets that suit my customer
23/05/24, 10:13 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I recently saw Peoplehum demo and liked it though not implemented to any customer yet <This message was edited>
23/05/24, 10:14 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: *people
23/05/24, 10:15 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Had seen HRone product, that is also one of the promising product. Got good reviews on their customer support
23/05/24, 10:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yup. They seem to be reorganizing
23/05/24, 10:45 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: Freshteam is shut. They don’t take new customers anymore and will only be providing maintenance for any new customers. They won’t be building anything new either.
23/05/24, 10:46 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: Have tried it it has only basic features
23/05/24, 10:49 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I have used trackstar from their recruiterbox days....it serves the purpose.
23/05/24, 10:49 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: When we say a particular ATS is 'basic' or not, what are you folks referring to as not basic?

Is it the automations, personalisation or data presentation?
23/05/24, 10:50 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Ya. The software is flexible , it's good. Not sure why they are not developing it further! Personally I have given feedback to Kartik and Abhash
23/05/24, 10:50 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Though there are so many products,  it's not solving our ground issues
23/05/24, 10:52 - Lakshmy K HR TBC1: I took a stand-alone Keka ATS for my previous company in 2022. They brought in a lot of changes over the last  year. Again, it depends on the use case. I didn’t face any issues with their customers support as well.
23/05/24, 10:59 - Shreyanka Trivedi Head Of People Squadstack: Hey , anyone used widespread HR ?
23/05/24, 11:01 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: I recommend HRMS tool when their head count crosses 40, 50. It works. Till such time, excel sheet is good enough.
23/05/24, 11:05 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I strongly disagree
23/05/24, 11:06 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I have scaled teams from 4 to 50 majorly and I know the how a good ATS improves hiring decisions
23/05/24, 11:07 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Infact it is more necessary when we are hiring the initial core team.
23/05/24, 11:08 - Punret Beotra Human Capital BEENEXT: have to guys tried Snaphunt’s ATS tool by any chance?
23/05/24, 11:56 - Neha Sahi Trell HR: Do not recommend
23/05/24, 12:30 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I think ATS is a great discussion for our next breakfast club 😉
23/05/24, 12:50 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Yes
23/05/24, 13:58 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Hi Amy senior connects in Razorpayx payroll who can help me get a demo for my org?
We are using it but I am not aware of the full potential of the tool 
I feel we are underutilising it
23/05/24, 15:03 - Namita Nambiar TA Groww: Hi All, 
Do you have a structured hiring framework for converting interns to full-time employees, or is it determined by stakeholder needs?
23/05/24, 15:05 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: We have a 4-6 months of internship period and evaluations in between, then we have a conversion call taken for their conversion.
23/05/24, 15:06 - Namita Nambiar TA Groww: Based on what evaluation criterias do you convert?
23/05/24, 15:07 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: We have a set evaluation form like how well they delivered on the tasks given, Learning, Atitude etc
23/05/24, 17:04 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: 6 months is the internship period. 

1. Performances &  Behaviour are the 2 main key elements.

28/05/24, 13:43 - Shamini Abraham Culture & Talent Headout: Hello everyone, 
Working on setting up BGV process. Was looking for some inputs: 

1. What platform do you use for BGV? 
2. Do y'all undertake BGV for all incoming hires or only a subset of them. If it's the latter, then on what basis is the subset chosen (is it role/dept/hierarchy-wise or some other additional parameters are considered)?
3. Do y'all undertake a standard one-piece-fits-all approach for all hires where BGV is done or do y'all verify different parameters based on the role/person being hired
4. What type of BGV checks have yall opted for and what was the rationale for it
5. Do the documents need to be submitted/uploaded by the HR, or does the platform ask for documents from the candidate? Did you have a choice of choosing between the two? <This message was edited>
28/05/24, 14:03 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: 1.⁠ ⁠What platform do you use for BGV? _SpringVerify_
2.⁠ ⁠Do y'all undertake BGV for all incoming hires or only a subset of them. If it's the latter, then on what basis is the subset chosen (is it role/dept/hierarchy-wise or some other additional parameters are considered)? _All full-time hires_
3.⁠ ⁠Do y'all undertake a standard one-piece-fits-all approach for all hires where BGV is done or do y'all verify different parameters based on the role/person being hired. _We have a one-size-fits-all approach. It can be customised for exec hires if needed_
4.⁠ ⁠What type of BGV checks have yall opted for and what was the rationale for it _Identity, court checks (includes address check too), employment checks (last 2 employers, no reference check), education check (highest degree). Rationale was that these checks suffice the elements we would want to check for any hires, and does not cause any legal implications later. For specific cases, we can include a ref check if necessary - eg. exec hires._
5.⁠ ⁠Do the documents need to be submitted/uploaded by the HR, or does the platform ask for documents from the candidate? Did you have a choice of choosing between the two? _Yes, there is a choice, and we ask the candidates to upload it._
28/05/24, 14:04 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: 1)Genesis, springverify 
2) all hires
3)kmp diff and for rest other same 
4) basis clients you are going to work with and industry you are in this gets decided, at an avg 6 to 7 parameters are basic like employer check, kyc, education etc
5)both can be done, we let the candidate upload direct to save tat and integrated bgv software to our hrms <This message was edited>

28/05/24, 16:38 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: If they don't ask you to pay anything, then even if it's not genuine, you're being paid 😂. But if they ask even for Rs 1, then fake.
28/05/24, 16:39 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Also you'll know based on the kind of work they would be giving you. But yes paying $350 an hour seems ludacris...
28/05/24, 16:40 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: But these days I get atleast 2 such inmails in a month so not sure if this is the new way of scam but when you go on the persons profile shows like a valid user

29/05/24, 13:24 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: For local conveyance we used reimburse the actual cost of ola/uber/rapido etc etc which ever is the mode. 
This is applicable for customer meetings.
29/05/24, 13:27 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: But then some companies do per km charges for 2 wheeler/4 wheeler  then taxi budgets etc etc
29/05/24, 13:32 - You added Saloni Dagly Associate Director TA Leap
29/05/24, 14:03 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Iv done both, but in our case at actuls is not working so trying to see per km bench marking
29/05/24, 14:23 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I will share it but it's not revised for last 2 years
29/05/24, 14:23 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Su may have to add some inflation
29/05/24, 14:29 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: We reimburse as follows for local travel :
Meals: 
Metro city: 1500 per day 
Non metro : 1000 per day 
Using Ola/Uber : Reimbursement on actual billing amount 

Using own vehicle :
2 wheeler : Rs. 5.5/KM
4 wheeler : Rs. 12/Km
29/05/24, 14:30 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: I have /km bench making with cute t inflation
29/05/24, 14:30 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: I need cab reimbursement limit as that is where we are getting burn 
Got a bill of 200 for 1 km
29/05/24, 14:40 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: We tried to set the limit, For cab it’s not possible to go by the book, cab price rises and fall, considering peak hours, rainy days, festival etc. hence we go with the actual bill
29/05/24, 14:41 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: Anyone leads from rapido recruiting team ??
29/05/24, 14:54 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Iv put a rule to fix this -
Bookings to be done for hatch backs and lowest price options available for all and cxo at actuals
29/05/24, 15:00 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: 👍

30/05/24, 09:17 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Guys what are different ways you ensure you hv pipeline readiness for difficult and repetitive roles in your organisation? Also are there any alternate channels working for you in dev side ?
30/05/24, 09:18 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Last I knew it hasn’t been announced

30/05/24, 09:29 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Hv a few contacts
30/05/24, 11:08 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Hey folks!

I was surfing through career portals and noticed about 20-30% of the JDs having the following CTA at the end of the it - 

*To apply for the position you can send us an email at careers@whatever.com with “Application - <Role name>_<your name>” with your updated CV and a small note about yourself*

Is this done to avoid Hiring platform fee or is there more to it?
30/05/24, 11:13 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: How would this avoid hiring platform fee?
30/05/24, 11:14 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Instahyre charges you for profile viewed or downloaded. Sometimes orgs have agencies on 8% commissions as well. Not sure of the exact motives. But why would folks want an email to be sent if the system already exists?
30/05/24, 11:14 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Only to filter incoming resumes in correct folders based on set mail rules
30/05/24, 11:15 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Some ATS complicates process unnecessarily and filtering becomes cumbersome
30/05/24, 11:16 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Personally I don’t do this but understand for some folks where getting it directly on mail is helpful if they are power users
30/05/24, 11:16 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: careers@xx.com might be intergrated with their ATS in the backend. It just helps the company to collect the resumes in one place in the backend. Else it is stored in multiple job prtals, use chrome extensions or upload them etc etc <This message was edited>
30/05/24, 11:17 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Oh, interesting!
30/05/24, 11:21 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Some companies make careers as group email as well so that multiple people involved in hiring can take a look at it. This is more of a practice when they dont have ATS and they dont want resumes to be just constrained to personal mail boxes.
30/05/24, 11:22 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: But then many portals dont allow to regitser group emails
30/05/24, 11:23 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Is there an ATS that gives candidate recommendation to recruiter within the tool for a particular JD after it has funneled a decent number of applications?
30/05/24, 11:23 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: I see
30/05/24, 11:24 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Now a days ATS are ranking resumes....depending on the JD keywords and resume keywords., screening questions etc etc
30/05/24, 11:25 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: basically what was achived through filter is now automated <This message was edited>
30/05/24, 11:27 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I am yet to test the efficiency of these scanners

30/05/24, 18:06 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: One random question - 

On average, how many candidates do you guys source to close one role.. lets say a sde2 backend engineer role
30/05/24, 19:33 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Depends on the tech stack bro
30/05/24, 19:42 - +91 91081 93009: 5:1
30/05/24, 19:42 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Fair point!
30/05/24, 19:43 - Arvindh Murthy HR: I was thinking if it’s a niche skill then the ratio might be higher na ?
30/05/24, 21:10 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Hi Folks,

30/05/24, 22:22 - +91 91081 93009: If you plan right, it can be same or even lower ( if there is a scarcity of that skills)
30/05/24, 23:32 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Hello Everyone,

I am currently in the process of implementing Freshteams ATS for a startup company. If anyone could help me connect with an account manager, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance!
30/05/24, 23:35 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: You need to send mail to support@freshteam.com
I don't think They give direct contact details to account managers. They give link to block their slot to connect via Calendly.
30/05/24, 23:36 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Got it! Thanks🙌🏼
30/05/24, 23:38 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: This is how we did to move employees from Singapore 
1. Flight tickets for dependents (children and spouse)
2. 2 weeks stay in hotel 
3. ⁠Food reimbursement for 2 weeks 
4. ⁠Pay for brokerage 
5. ⁠Reimbursement for moving household goods,⁠ if applicable
6. ⁠Reimbursement for visa expenses <This message was edited>
30/05/24, 23:43 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Thank you so much
31/05/24, 00:17 - Simar RR: Depends on the Tech stack but ideally it's 5:1
31/05/24, 00:38 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Depends on role but for example we have 3-4 rounds of interviews. R1 is Exploratory call to do basic checks and mutual alignment of skills by one of the interviewer, then R2 Technical round to check Depth of mandatory skills then R3 covers Breadth of overall skills, and final round is cultural fitment or HMs discussion. Now ideally for every 5 candidates who reach Final round 1 should get offer. In worst case 7 anything above that the interview process should be reviewed if assessment is correct. Now for every 5 candidates to reach HM round atleast 7-10 go through Technical rounds. And for those 7-10 technical rounds atleast 12-15 screened and Shortlisted candidates to be lined up. And to get those 12-15 shortlisted candidates you may need to source 20-30 candidates, screen and shortlist top candidates meeting the criteria. Now it may happen that role gets closed in first 3 candidates you line up or in some cases when expectations are high from HMs it can take months to close as well. Good to backtrack and see what usually works for each skills, candidate pool size,  demographics, Quarter in which hiring request are made (Example Candidates are less likely to switch close to appraisals in quarter 4 hence even if people take offers there is high chances they use it to their benefits and negotiate internally) and many other variables. So there is no one size fits all answer to this.
31/05/24, 02:23 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 5:1 is too high for 1 offer from 5 finalists. We should relook panel alignment with HM immediately if it goes above 2:1 and not let it go above 4:1. I feel terrible and a failure even with 3:1.
31/05/24, 02:25 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Before Kshitij’s message I was thinking everyone is a rockstar to be clearing 1 offer from 5 screening shortlists and I am dumbo 😆
31/05/24, 06:00 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Haha... As mentioned it is not one size fit all. Lot depends on recruiter screening and many variable factors. It's not always as easy as you said and Rockstar like yourself definitely knows that 😉
31/05/24, 09:33 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Touché !! 😄
31/05/24, 09:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: No you aren’t 😊
From interviewing to offer ideal is 1:8 or 10 even in bigger orgs
31/05/24, 10:36 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: this was the no that I had in mind. but everyone saying ki just interviewing 4 candidates to close 1 role.. am i too slow for the world
31/05/24, 11:04 - Chandni Jumani RR: It depends on the role - the ratio can vary (the role can go through iterations too based on these interviews)
31/05/24, 11:41 - Sayali Naik: Hey, need a little help.

31/05/24, 13:01 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This is a journey in my view and as recruiters at heart,  this ratio will  keep varying and we will keep working towards it 👍I waz lucky enough to have enjoyed good offer to joining ratios. <This message was edited>

31/05/24, 13:29 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: try out our quickscreen assessments. we have 80% completion rate :)
31/05/24, 13:31 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Our hiring managers prefer to design their own assignments which resonates with the work they will be doing. So for us it was more than number of completions, who completes it.
31/05/24, 13:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: so if someone has taken time to complete the assignment, and is shortlisted, probability of he clearing our tech panel is high. So our focus was on right people in our radar to complete the assignment.
31/05/24, 13:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We also used Hackerrank for some roles.
31/05/24, 13:38 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: so there are pros and cons of both approaches. depends on at what time you want what.

If you are sending a 2-3 days or even a 6-8 hrs project assignment, nothing is a replacement for that. they are best. But if you are sending a 1-2 hr take home assignment, I have seen that the more crispier the assignment is, it's better since you are able to keep them engaged and the final shortlisting is almost same.
31/05/24, 13:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yes, it depends on what the desired output is. For some we have asked them to share Code and if good grilled them on their code source also. Time of submission was chosen by candidates similar to the way they estimate. This was one of the observations in our selection process, how they estimated, were they able to complete within that timeline if not how did they handle us...etc etc <This message was edited>

31/05/24, 19:03 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: Which is free recruiting tool for non - IT hiring
31/05/24, 19:20 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Folks, what is the industry standard for LinkedIn InMail response rate? Does it vary for roles? If yes, can you help me understand what it is for most common roles that you work on? 

What is the current response rate for you guys? 

Working on a project to better our outbound game and wanted to understand how you guys are dealing with InMails.
31/05/24, 19:29 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: For me:
- Till lead level - 80% for techies and 90% for product designers
- ⁠Manager+ - 60% for techies and 50% for designers. 
- ⁠I’ve not used it for product folks. 
- ⁠At a time I send 30 InMails at max.
- ⁠I am counting message decline (I am not interested) as also a response. 20-25% of total. <This message was edited>
31/05/24, 19:33 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I don’t send 500s though. Only about 30-50 per difficult role (not every role). Toh someone with higher messages will have better data to offset my numbers. <This message was edited>
31/05/24, 19:35 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Context for usage may matter too. I started using it properly only from 2020, when messages used to be unlimited per enterprise account 😁
31/05/24, 19:36 - +91 91081 93009: 5:1 is onsite to offers and it's a broad range and it definitely is different across roles based on the skills but what also is important is the hiring maturity curve and the hiring culture, hm commitment to hire  conversion ratios
31/05/24, 19:37 - +91 91081 93009: Conversion ratios cannot be evaluated in isolation
31/05/24, 19:37 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Got it! Thanks, Sukant. 

Any data for non-tech roles that you have?
31/05/24, 19:39 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Also, I’m assuming this number changed for you depending on the org you were representing?
31/05/24, 19:41 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Mujhe tension ho jayegi if my Director/VP/CXO positio rejects 3 of my finalists. I will question my life decisions and I will start thinking ki job gayi as I am wasting so much of their time (90mins atleast by this point). 
Isliye 2nd reject ke baad hi I setup alignment call with my panelists and HM to go over those rejected finalists + 2-3 similar upcoming cases. Yaha par pata chalta hain ki interview process was misaligned - HM ne kuch aur bola hain and panelists are not covering that and these folks reach final round.
31/05/24, 19:42 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Regardless of roles 5 finalists being rejected means there’s a big flaw in process that needs to be fixed immediately (not recruiter’s fault it exists but our responsibility that it gets fixed)
31/05/24, 19:43 - +91 91081 93009: How do you scale this solution,  how many hiring managers do you work for at the same time ? @⁨Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared⁩
31/05/24, 19:43 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Haan branding affects 10-20% upar neeche.
31/05/24, 19:44 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Have only done non tech in my current company (head of marketing role for which response was 100% in 12 messages). So too small a sample size to be useful to your research
31/05/24, 19:46 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Why does it need to scale? I’ve handled max 6-7 HMs at a time. This is easily doable na. This alignment call only needs to be 15 mins. Even HMs won’t have time
31/05/24, 19:47 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: If this has happened at multiple roles, the call is separate. But the whole purpose is this won’t be common. It’s rare hence the emergency call.
31/05/24, 19:47 - +91 91081 93009: How do you handle conversion ratios at scale?
31/05/24, 19:48 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Oh, you’re asking for Inmail? Sorry I misread
31/05/24, 19:49 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Maine toh bola hi I don’t mass message 😀 30-50 at a time is more than enough to fill my role with inbounds too. I am not the right person to ask Inmail conversion at scale 😊
31/05/24, 19:51 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Does anybody know if SuperDM has solved problem of handling these messages at scale? <This message was edited>
31/05/24, 19:51 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: Late responses
31/05/24, 19:53 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I do remember we reached out to 100+ EMs (almost all considerable audience for the role) once to hire 2-3 and responses were both terse and slow and we closed 2 through inbound 😆 I am a big proponent of inbound
31/05/24, 19:54 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Oh it helps only for late responses you mean?
31/05/24, 19:54 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: I didn’t work for me
31/05/24, 19:55 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Acha. Main bhi waitlist mein hi hu 😆
31/05/24, 20:03 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: <Media omitted>
31/05/24, 20:15 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Yeh toh best way hain hi 👏👏
31/05/24, 20:18 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: we have helped companies to achieve a 2:1 onsite ratiowho were hiring 100 engineers (or even 2)per month. Try IV ;)
31/05/24, 20:20 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: We can have this topic in our next meet up . 😁
31/05/24, 20:21 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: This is insanely good. Can you share your templates please? 

I haven’t done outbound in the last few months, but my response rates never crossed 50%. This is after enhancing templates and sending messages at certain time. 
Again, the org I was representing was an early stage org, and the target audience was from mature orgs. <This message was edited>
31/05/24, 20:24 - Alok Singh Baghel Recro: Agree on this 🙌🏻
31/05/24, 20:39 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: What is really helping you guys capture all this data ? Usage of ATS 100 %, LinkedIn , candidate tracker ?
31/05/24, 20:39 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Tbh I am struggling with maintaining funnel data if not for the system
31/05/24, 20:40 - Suyash Kumar: Ok. So let's do an online meetup where everyone can share learnings?
31/05/24, 20:40 - Suyash Kumar: Yay 👍🏻 nay 👎🏻
31/05/24, 20:44 - +91 81499 28975: Hi Guys, I need your valuable suggestions on my situation. I am unemployed since 1 year after being laid off  and I m trying to get opportunity but unfortunately things are not working here. Now when I m appearing for interviews mostly I get judged on my career gap and most difficult is to answer what I was doing in this span of time. Honestly apart from job searching I was also focusing on my health which was not good at same time. Please help me as a HM/HR or founder what will you except and how to tackle this question.
31/05/24, 21:07 - Suyash Kumar: First of all, thank you so much for sharing this here. It's not easy to be vulnerable and share. So thank you for trusting us
31/05/24, 21:08 - Suyash Kumar: Do share a bit more. What do you generally tell them when it comes to the question of explaining your career gap? Also, has anyone shared any feedback about why they chose not to go with you for a position?
31/05/24, 21:27 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Hello Neha , I have built tracker which will be very useful . Let me know best time I can give you demo . Thanks
31/05/24, 21:38 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: Would like to see the demo as well
31/05/24, 22:37 - Kiran Ksheersagar Senior TA Specialist Arcesium: Hey

Anyone here from netapp
31/05/24, 23:10 - Suyash Kumar: Don't think so
01/06/24, 07:51 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Sure , let’s connect
01/06/24, 08:53 - +91 81499 28975: Yes , i recieved feedback which goes like "everything is okay but we think due to your focus towards health in gap we won't be able to take you in team .  Another feedback is like your current is something we can't match , and someplace expected CTC can't be matched so they ask me to go less than my current due to gap nd unemployment. Some HR take all rounds and at the offer time they simply reject by stating my  PG education which is not from Bschool or not regular (i did MBA from distance learning).
01/06/24, 08:59 - +91 81499 28975: In earlier times I told how market situation nd how it reflects to my job search . In earlier times I told them about my health due to which first 6 mnth my 80%focus was towards my well being (i was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, PCOS, PTSD,Panic attacks and low HB) but now I m hesitant to share with pannel.
01/06/24, 11:20 - Suyash Kumar: I hear you Shweta.
01/06/24, 11:20 - Suyash Kumar: Anyone else here who has experienced the same thing as an interviewee or interviewer?
01/06/24, 11:25 - Suyash Kumar: @⁨Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini⁩ please share your experience if you're comfortable
01/06/24, 11:58 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: Recently, I spoke with a candidate who had a gap in his resume. When I asked about the reasons, he told me how he spent that time traveling and volunteering globally. He went on to explain how this experience gave him an exceptional adaptability and cultural sensitivity, qualities that are invaluable in our increasingly global workplace.

Lesson learned - Never underestimate the power of life experiences!

I jst read thia on LinkedIn.. N may be helpful for u..

It may be tough to get back after a break.
But I think u need to focus on positives, how it has helped u as a person.. What all have u done to keep u updated on trends / industry connects etc..
01/06/24, 12:05 - Salonee Bhatia Lead TA Tanla: I have had candidates who have taken a break for 6 months or more due to medical conditions, I just ensure they are healthy to come back to work. While some have due to family reasons take a break, life happens and judging someone based on that is wrong. 

Like Mitch said you will have to focus on the positives.
01/06/24, 12:06 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: I had a family member who went through this in covid, the company had taken back their offer and then it took the person a year to find the next role but we kept the person motivated and encouraged to do what they liked, finally got a role they wanted and we choose the path of honesty that helped
01/06/24, 12:13 - Mehvish K HR Head Travelwings: Hi Shweta,

Thanks for sharing. 
I think it's better to keep it simple and say that you were not keeping well and went to stay with your family.

Also, if something is suitable to your profile, go ahead and take that job at a lesser pay, work for 1.5 years and make up for the career gap professionally. You can bargain a higher pay while you're in the job while looking for other opportunities. 

You could compromise on money, a bit for a while, but do not compromise on the role. 

I say this because it is true that distance MBA candidates are less preferred in the job market, unfortunately, so once you land something focus on performance and upskilling. 

I will also say one year gap is nothing, we have returning mothers I have hired in my office after 3-4 years of maternity break and they are thriving.

Patience is going to be key.
And like other community members have said earlier - make a list of things that you learned in your gap year (without sounding too philosophical) and talk about them in the interview. 

Also, DM me your resumé, let me see if I can refer. Thanks.
01/06/24, 12:18 - Saif Sayed HR Head Aiolos: Hey Shweta
Can you share your updated resume here and I guess we all can tap into our networks to help you out.

05/06/24, 10:59 - Suyash Kumar: That is sooo cool Aparna
05/06/24, 11:22 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: what 's the thought from the cult here
05/06/24, 11:23 - Suyash Kumar: Cult? 🤣

05/06/24, 11:41 - Suyash Kumar: One major insight, which I think has been obvious to a lot of us from our own experiences too, is the power of networking
05/06/24, 11:41 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: Indeed!!
05/06/24, 11:41 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: 100%
05/06/24, 11:47 - Suyash Kumar: <Media omitted>
05/06/24, 11:57 - Suyash Kumar: So any tips from anyone here on the questions raised here?
How to network authentically?
What kind of PPL should you network with?
05/06/24, 12:13 - Rupali Sharma HR Matrix Partners: True Networking is a lot of giving back first...for the flywheel to fall in place such a way that it starts giving back to you
05/06/24, 12:16 - Chandni Jumani RR: I understand we need to connect with people when we need help/information but "networking" per se shouldn't be with an agenda. Your intention behind every interaction counts. 
That equation goes a long way when the intention is clear and not just because you're looking for a favourable outcome for yourself.
05/06/24, 12:17 - Suyash Kumar: Oh 100% 
Networking can't be superficial and purely transactional
05/06/24, 12:17 - Suyash Kumar: And most PPL see through it I think.
05/06/24, 13:38 - Gaurav Uniyal TA Head 91Squarefeet: agreed
05/06/24, 13:42 - Gaurav Uniyal TA Head 91Squarefeet: Adding to Chandni’s point, I think you as personality also matters few people have this initiate nature they makes it look very easy, they easily gel up with people and have social awareness to connect to dots, that I think I quite crucial to networking.
To connect authentically, one need to see the other person as it is no biases, open to all possibilities, <This message was edited>
05/06/24, 13:50 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: There’s a noticeable trend where HR professionals often connect and engage with their network specially on LinkedIn, mainly when they are seeking new job opportunities or hiring for a particular role, and hide their profiles or limitating the connection requests by allowing only people who have their email IDs or in their contact list to connect, once they secure employment. This approach can limit the potential for building sustained, meaningful professional relationships and networking that can be beneficial in the long term, both for career growth and for fostering a supportive HR community.
Lots of HRs put “hiring” in their profile but are never active on LinkedIn or respond to applications. 
Connections we get everyday on the platform will be beneficial in the long run either  to get you a job or you find them a job. 
Let’s promote supportive HR community, helping others find their dream job. <This message was edited>

05/06/24, 22:56 - Suyash Kumar: Instead of asking me to tell them about myself, they can ask her only
05/06/24, 23:20 - Chandni Jumani RR: This actually happened in one of my previous organisations where a fresher brought her mother along for the interview(s)
My colleague (the interviewer) was kind enough to have lunch with them to put both of them at ease 
(Mum didn’t participate, of course)
05/06/24, 23:25 - Suyash Kumar: Damn. I'm sure she would have been an asset for the candidate when it came to negotiating the salary
05/06/24, 23:25 - Suyash Kumar: If she had done it
05/06/24, 23:25 - Suyash Kumar: But that's so sweet of the recruiter
05/06/24, 23:30 - Chandni Jumani RR: This is actually one of the Senior Engineering folks who sat with them :)
05/06/24, 23:30 - Suyash Kumar: That's very nice of them
06/06/24, 12:08 - Asha S K Sr. HR Administrator Unient: Mom's introduction will be another level 🤪
06/06/24, 12:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: So we had offered a girl for ROR developer role few years back...she was from Indore. Her father was so tensed to send her to Blore...I spoke to her father and clarified on all his doubts....we then invited him on the joining day, introduced the whole team, provided accommodation for him to stay in Blore for a week so that he is assured that she is in a safe place. 

I used to get his call monthly once for many months.
She emerged to be one of the best devs and today leading products in Cisco. Feels good to have supported her during those days..... <This message was edited>
06/06/24, 12:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Human factor of "HR" after all!
06/06/24, 12:34 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: Great 👏🏻
06/06/24, 14:09 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Folks has anyone used CompUp compensation benchmarking services?
06/06/24, 16:53 - Harika Velaga RR: Hey Kshitij I have used for appraisals at one of the firms.
06/06/24, 16:57 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: How was your experience? Is it good compared to AON and Mercer etc?
06/06/24, 16:59 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Aon mercer are exit polls whereas CompUp gives you actual count 😛 (they give you the info for free but take your complete salary data)
06/06/24, 16:59 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: That’s what they offered and I’ve declined them in 2 separate companies
06/06/24, 17:00 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: They asked for our companies’ HR sheet data
06/06/24, 17:02 - Harika Velaga RR: It's the same with any benchmarking company. They ask for your data but in a masked format.
06/06/24, 17:06 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: I have used them, they’re useful. You get updated data at any given point, not just after the comp study. Not 100% sure about the accuracy; so I wouldn’t depend on them solely. 

They ask for your masked comp data, so that’s the only con. I would recommend them.
06/06/24, 17:20 - Harika Velaga RR: Anyone has ATS cost points? If you have done the research and don't mind sharing pls DM.
06/06/24, 17:20 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Any provider - Aon, Mercer, Radford take your compensation data. That's the way they are able to provide you cuts of data based on certain competitor details you need..
06/06/24, 17:21 - Saif Sayed HR Head Aiolos: Someone has sent the complete analysis in the group few weeks back
06/06/24, 17:27 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I know 😀 but I found CompUp’s platform access more useful instead of one time data from others
06/06/24, 17:34 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: It's also live data & keeps getting refreshed every month. There is certain merit in what Anurag & the team are building..
06/06/24, 18:14 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: any one has any idea / user experince in pyjama hr & tobu - m evaluating both - hence asked.
06/06/24, 19:00 - Vikram Bhardwaj Director TA Yellow.ai: Hey Mitcch..I took a demo of pyajama hr..wasn't impressed. And opted for sense.
06/06/24, 19:00 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: thank you, will check sense
06/06/24, 19:00 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: also it depends on requirement.. m looking at something very basic.. getting all resumes in place and if i can track updates would be great/
06/06/24, 19:02 - Vikram Bhardwaj Director TA Yellow.ai: That's all we wanted. Try sense.
06/06/24, 19:03 - Vikram Bhardwaj Director TA Yellow.ai: I will share the poc number with you
06/06/24, 19:03 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: Sense is good for that..
06/06/24, 20:51 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Do we folks here who work in orgs that use Rasayel/ Wati/AiSensy/ Interakt as CRM?

06/06/24, 20:58 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: both these tools are at no-cost? for small setup up and basic features is good to have
06/06/24, 22:49 - Suyash Kumar: Then check SpringRecruit also
07/06/24, 01:20 - Gaurav Kumar HR Coordinator Fanatics: Anyone from Accenture here?
07/06/24, 08:33 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: Wil do
07/06/24, 08:34 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: U mean pyjama & sense?
07/06/24, 08:42 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Very very basic doesn't work
07/06/24, 08:42 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If they improve the product, it will be one of the best ATS for sure 👍
07/06/24, 08:48 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: https://cvviz.com/
Any one heard of this one?
07/06/24, 08:49 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Evaluating this...
07/06/24, 08:49 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: Same here..
07/06/24, 10:33 - Abhishek Nadagowd TA Apollo.io: Hi Everyone,
How is your company or in past, assessing new graduates (less than 1 years of experience) for Backend roles before getting them into Technical interviews? 
Right now we are using Coderbyte platform with different sets of questions (easy to medium level)
07/06/24, 10:34 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: We used hackerearth
07/06/24, 10:34 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: earlier that we had an assignment prepared by the hiring manager which they had to complete and submit
07/06/24, 10:36 - Abhishek Nadagowd TA Apollo.io: Ok. Any other interview stage recommendations that can be considered apart from using platforms to assess?
07/06/24, 10:37 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: peer coding you can consider
07/06/24, 10:37 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: We've used assignments. They share the link by uploading the solution to github
07/06/24, 10:37 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: Yes peer coding too!
07/06/24, 10:39 - Abhishek Nadagowd TA Apollo.io: Cool thanks for the inputs. If anyone else has anymore recommendations, please share, thanks
07/06/24, 10:39 - Jay Cred hR: not sure but maybe InterviewVector can help.
07/06/24, 10:43 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Codechef works well too
07/06/24, 10:44 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: would love to know the current challenges that you are facing right now
07/06/24, 10:45 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: at IV, we have built an assessment platform as well. but would love to know the challenges first
07/06/24, 10:45 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Connect with @⁨Sachin Mittal InterviewVector⁩ he will help you
07/06/24, 11:02 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: geeksforgeeks, eLitmus worked out really well. There is an training academy called DCT academy which trains people well. Got few good talent from there as well.
07/06/24, 11:04 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Geekstrust is also a good platform to explore. 

It's important to understand what kind of people are there in these platforms.
07/06/24, 11:06 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: What worked for us : Problem solving + Assessment in the first round.
2nd round : Fundamentals in programming
3rd Round : Detailed chat with the hiring manager mostly in our case it was technical architect.
07/06/24, 11:07 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Followed by HR.
07/06/24, 11:07 - Arvindh Murthy HR: This is an awesome flow man !! Covers everything
07/06/24, 11:18 - Abhishek Nadagowd TA Apollo.io: 1. Hiring Managers would like to hire the bars for overall interview process starting with Assessments.
2. ⁠Coderbyte platform abruptly terminates during the interviews, hence panels are asking to change the platform.
3. ⁠Since we are considering candidates only from IIT’s, discussing if we need to go with (2 Medium + 1 Hard) or just 2 Hard orquestions with time constraints of 60-90mins
07/06/24, 11:21 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 2 medium + 1 hard will help you sort quality. Many times the person who has solved 1 hard + 1 medium will be better than the one who solved 2 medium ones
07/06/24, 11:21 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: My tech team waz  using coderpad

That's concerning
07/06/24, 14:50 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Because their focus is less on i and more on yOu

11/06/24, 18:13 - Suyash Kumar: It's very subjective as there isn't a formal definition of tier 1, tier 2 etc.

Is there anyone using LinkedIn hiring enterprise program in your company ? Is it for global access ? If yes , kindly dm, need some inputs <This message was edited>
13/06/24, 17:45 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: You mean the recruiter licence ?
13/06/24, 17:45 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: The unlimited platform that they for hiring
13/06/24, 17:45 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Hiring enterprise program
13/06/24, 17:46 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: the one with global access we are using
13/06/24, 17:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Guess the pricing differs if it’s global or India centric 
I am looking to talk to someone who is using it currently
13/06/24, 17:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I will ping you
13/06/24, 17:50 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: I have used global bit that was 2 years back so won’t help
13/06/24, 17:54 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: one random question - from some time (last 2-2.5 years), recruiters posts about candidates joining their org, have been popping up a lot in my linkedin feed.

noob question - why is anyone doing that? any benefits? <This message was edited>
13/06/24, 17:56 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: You are referring to posts where recruiters are writing about candidate joining their org 
I think it’s way of branding in my opinion
13/06/24, 17:56 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: haan. a lot of posts with photos
13/06/24, 17:57 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah Rippling is doing that a lot I see
13/06/24, 17:57 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: haan. @⁨~Arun⁩ is a culprit too :P
13/06/24, 17:57 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I think it’s in a way helping branding related activities
13/06/24, 17:57 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Arun from Rippling if in the group can answer or Mahesh how it helps them
13/06/24, 17:58 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Firstly , To showcase that they are hiring folks in big time and secondly they want to built the network so that they will have. maximum impressions to their individual page and company profile . That’s the smart way of doing branding .
13/06/24, 17:59 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Also, my point is different "The fact is that the recruiter who is posting about his/her candidate joining increases their chances to be targeted for their next role" 😉
13/06/24, 18:01 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Valid point !
13/06/24, 18:03 - Shweta Gupta HR Head AirMDR: Recruiter is trying to do some branding + enhancing reach of his linkedin.
13/06/24, 18:30 - Kosha Trivedi Technical Recruiter TopHire: Adding on top of what everyone has mentioned, some candidates don't update their LinkedIn in the initial days of joining a new org, if they are looking out. 

If the recruiter/org proactively posts about their new joiners and tags them, it's all over their feed and lesser chances of candidates leaving soon after joining.
13/06/24, 18:43 - Arvindh Murthy HR: I think that’s the best way to look at it!!
13/06/24, 18:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: As far as I know, they don't care of these !
13/06/24, 18:48 - Fireside Sayana Dutta: It can create some pressure but at d end of the day if they feel they badly need to change, anyway they will
13/06/24, 18:56 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: This is definitely one of the best things to consider. 

I had similar encounters with 3 of our new employees on different occasions. 

When asked to update their LinkedIn profiles. 3 new employees have hesitated. 

2 of them left within 2 weeks - 1 month & the other candidate failed in their Background Verification. 

So the guess / suspicion was right at the beginning when they’ve hesitated to update their LinkedIn profiles. <This message was edited>
13/06/24, 18:57 - Tejaswi Vajinepalli Asst. Manager HRBP LEAD: Most of our employees in field sales don't have an active Linkedin profile, in that case, this might not help.
13/06/24, 19:06 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: I agree with all the points here. The recruiter gets access the network of the new joiner

13/06/24, 19:13 - Suyash Kumar: @⁨Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR⁩
13/06/24, 19:13 - Ajesh Nair MyGate TA: Awesome
13/06/24, 20:21 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: Many people prefer to give it some time before which they update. 
LI updation is a personal choice and a public platform , while I understand it has it s merits of updating the org they are part of.
No employer can nudge to follow, post, update for the sake of employer branding. Its a personal space so long the content that goes out is not to defame any org in normal context.

Final HR discussion 

This is for leads or architect
14/06/24, 11:35 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: +1 to it. 

For leads / architects, I honestly don't recommend assignment/quick test. 

Instead a Bar-raiser round can be kept after/before managerial round, which can go deep dive into coding and system design. The Bar raiser is taken by someone very senior (who is purely into tech) like principal engineer, or staff engineer, or DoE (who is a hands on person)
14/06/24, 12:27 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/american-bank-sacks-over-a-dozen-wfh-staff-who-used-mouse-movers/ar-BB1obwo9?ocid=winp2fptaskbarhover&cvid=2ace5c4795b94817880d13853eebf551&ei=10

14/06/24, 13:30 - Chandni Jumani RR: We have a logic and reasoning assessment everyone has to go through regardless of the level. It's a pseudo-code test. Usually, freshers are able to solve this better than experienced folks because Math is still fresh for them
Math is an integral part of the Engineering roles because we are data and number driven
Of course, this can be taken off if it's not relevant for the company/role.
14/06/24, 13:31 - Supraja HR Lead Qapita: May I know the name of the company?
14/06/24, 13:31 - +91 99865 56108: I see your point, but I think differently. Posting about candidates joining can help celebrate successes and build trust with the new joiner and future joiners too. While there might be some risk, I believe the benefits are greater.
14/06/24, 13:31 - Chandni Jumani RR: PriceLabs

18/06/24, 14:45 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: Is that a Linkedin US account with US payment options? Otherwise, when the card is about to expire and a new card gets activated, this happens. I remember paying Linkedin through NEFT a few years back.
18/06/24, 15:23 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: This is recent update.. In last couple of months.  Last year it was only cc which had saving & international option..

For Indian account with Indian payment mode.. Is the challenge.. 

Apple has managed it's way with upi.. No cards.. LinkedIn is still struggling.. <This message was edited>
18/06/24, 15:24 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: I am paying linkedin from 2010. Hence have seen the challenges!

18/06/24, 20:04 - Mridusha Bhaduri Sr. TA Specialist: Anybody has any idea about their BBA course?
18/06/24, 20:07 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: I know about MBA, not sure about BBA
18/06/24, 20:07 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Cool hai
18/06/24, 20:12 - Mridusha Bhaduri Sr. TA Specialist: If somebody has to choose between KIIT bhubaneswar and NMIS, Bangalore for BBA. What would be the best option?
18/06/24, 20:13 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: Does anyone have an idea on time to fill and and hire 
The average TAT for an early stage startup with comparatively less visibility in the industry/Market 
For Tech and product roles 
When it comes to inhouse hiring without staffing support.
18/06/24, 20:17 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Each role will be different 
Basis exp and skill sets
18/06/24, 20:18 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: NMIMS
18/06/24, 20:18 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Good Campus placements
18/06/24, 20:19 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Including MBB
18/06/24, 20:30 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: 60 days if everything goes as planned else it goes upto 90 days.
18/06/24, 20:33 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: Okay
18/06/24, 20:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: But sometimes we get lucky, 15 to  30 days for product owner/manager roles. Devs are the tough ones not just because of money or brand or demand-supply, but early stage start ups wants a lot of things in one candidate/not having a proper evaluation process/ decision making etc etc
18/06/24, 20:36 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: Exactly 💯
18/06/24, 20:38 - Lakshmy K HR TBC1: For product 30-45 days mid senior. Tech can go from 45days to 90days based on the hiring manager expectations.
18/06/24, 20:45 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: So we had hired a very senior consultant to  review few things in HR and guide us. She claimed that she used to  hire 300 people / month and she was surprised to see why our tat was very high !! That drove me to look at avg stats for dev roles and  was highly relieved that my score card wZ much better being a single person, sourcing all the roles internally.......Start ups got their own challenges and it's more tough when it's Bootstrapped.
18/06/24, 20:47 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Not sure who were hired like 300... freshers, etc etc then I came to know this wZ for a taxi aggregator company! I got my answer, who were on-boarded in those numbers 😀
18/06/24, 20:48 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: Yes 300 a month is insane
18/06/24, 20:49 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Huh 🤔
18/06/24, 21:11 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Just from my personal experience, NMIMS without a doubt. KIIT unfortunately was full of cheaters (95% had copied answers)
18/06/24, 21:12 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Oh for bba, I won’t know about KIIT. Sorry. My exp was for btech
18/06/24, 21:12 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 😣
18/06/24, 21:29 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: very right - the last pointer -no listening or open to ideas, evaluation & decision making
18/06/24, 22:07 - Asha S K Sr. HR Administrator Unient: NMIMS is good 👍
18/06/24, 22:15 - Mehvish K HR Head Travelwings: NMIMS Bangalore B-School placement team is very responsive and professional. I'll share one alum's number, you can also ask her experience if you like.

20/06/24, 11:30 - Fireside Dheeraj Nagar: We used a trial version of the Timechamp application, Does anyone can have any suggestions about this product?
20/06/24, 11:30 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Wo LinkedIn hai, kuch b kar skta hai!!! 🤪

Wish it's not true, and it's a prank.
20/06/24, 11:31 - Suyash Kumar: Would you like to share why you need these at all? <This message was edited>

03/07/24, 17:13 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hey All
I have a quick question-
So I heard it is better to have only Basic as part of the structure for below certain CTC (like 6 LPA or below).
Is it true? Does it make any difference? Or can we follow the same structure for anyone across the org?
03/07/24, 17:18 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: In my opinion, flexi pay structure are tax friendly for the employees
03/07/24, 17:21 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: There is no such rule. It benefits for tax purposes, like Shivani mentioned.
03/07/24, 17:23 - Sathya Thirugnanam Associate Consultant CIEL HR Services: IMO, 
It's beneficial to Employee if Basic is higher, 

While gratuity procession, we take last drawn basic.
03/07/24, 17:23 - Santhosh Arni Ravi Assistant Manager HR AtoS: For employees earning a lower salary (like 6 LPA or below), having a higher basic salary might not significantly impact their overall financial benefits due to lower statutory deductions and taxes. However, it depends on local tax laws and regulation

Is anyone using the IIM Jobs database? If yes, how is your experience?
09/07/24, 11:56 - Udita Saini Associate Director Iris Higherground: Database as in?
09/07/24, 11:58 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: They have their own database just like Naukri.
09/07/24, 11:58 - Udita Saini Associate Director Iris Higherground: Okay
09/07/24, 11:58 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I have used only their job posts. Used Hirist dB, DB and responses are better than Naukri <This message was edited>
09/07/24, 12:00 - Tejaswi Vajinepalli Asst. Manager HRBP LEAD: This has been acquired by Naukri.
If you are already using Naukri, this can be just an add-on
09/07/24, 12:10 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: We don't have Naukri, but might plan to take the same in some time.
So if we have to look separately at IIM Jobs database, how is it?
09/07/24, 12:13 - Tejaswi Vajinepalli Asst. Manager HRBP LEAD: niche, you would majorly find MBAs from tier 2 and tier 1 colleges with experience
09/07/24, 12:30 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Works for non tech roles 
Major bfsi
09/07/24, 12:33 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Yes
09/07/24, 12:36 - Reena P Sr. HR 56 Secure: We use for non tech hiring from mid to senior level. Pretty good database.
09/07/24, 12:41 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Better to take LinkedIn search
09/07/24, 12:48 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Do you mean LinkedIn Recruiter?
09/07/24, 12:49 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: No longer niche.. 
I used it last yr for wildcraft.quality has gone down..
But definitely different n a better than naukri.
Also It's largely for non tech - hr / sales / marketing..category role..
Also note the database won't have cvs less than 10 lacs..I think..

In job posting u will get lot of response. Across levels..
09/07/24, 12:51 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: +1. I used only their free job posting 😀
09/07/24, 12:53 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: I have used all free / paid job posts n database.. Using it since it was a blog page. So have seen the growth / quality etc
09/07/24, 12:55 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: any suggestion of a portal that can give quality inbounds for capital research, investment research, portfolio management hiring
09/07/24, 12:58 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: IIM jobs works for these kinds of roles
09/07/24, 12:59 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: So Mitcch, would you prefer that we continue with premium posting on the IIM jobs platform and go for Naukri database access?
09/07/24, 13:00 - Rajeswari S TA Manager Tally Solutions: Hi, 
You can check in LinkedIn. That also one of the better option.
09/07/24, 13:00 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: FYR, we do some niche hiring for candidates from top-tier colleges but also need to build our CS team for which we will need entry-level candidates data as well.
I have been receiving applications on premium posting, but it is limited at the end.
09/07/24, 13:00 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Comparing to IIMJobs and LinkedIn, LinkedIn has a database of Active and Passive candidates both whereas IIMJobs has only active ones.

IIMJobs has 90% of the data already on LinkedIn. Also, you can search or post and get relevant responses on LinkedIn better than IIMJobs
09/07/24, 13:01 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: So what are you suggesting for LinkedIn?
Purchasing the LinkedIn Recruiter license?
09/07/24, 13:02 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: yes
09/07/24, 13:08 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: I hope you understand the difference between the commercials for the IIM Jobs database and LinkedIn Recruiter.
09/07/24, 13:09 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: i would say - decide on below  points ROI vs investment - inbound vs outbound -  free or minimal job posts on linkedin / naukri / iim jobs - will it help ? or you need to have database access for instant reach / TAT; as there is a huge cost involved..
09/07/24, 13:09 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: piad job post can cost 1500 - 5K per job post on all these platforms.. valid for 30 dys on iim / naukri - linkedin is bidding..
09/07/24, 13:10 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: linkedin recruiter licence is 9K pm to few lacs.. depending on which one u take
09/07/24, 13:11 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: and like wise naukri / iim jobs database.. about few lacs a yr..
09/07/24, 13:12 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: naukri - has everything.. from fresher / 1 lac salary to upwards. iim job database is non tech - 10 lacs / better quality then naukri.. linkedin is an ocean.. a recruiter licence helps you but still doesnt give u all the contact etc..
09/07/24, 13:13 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Yeah, fair points.
Thanks, Mitcch.
09/07/24, 13:13 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: I agree. That's helpful for brainstorming.
09/07/24, 13:22 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Also, how is everyone posting jobs on LinkedIn in case they do not have the Recruiter License?
They do not allow free job posting after you receive 50 applications and we are not able to promote the jobs with Indian bank credit cards.

What are other ways? Can someone help here?
09/07/24, 13:25 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: We bought LinkedIn Job slots for 1.65L for 5 slots valid for a year
09/07/24, 13:25 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: You can post 5 live jobs at one go and keep replacing with new ones

Is thr anyone in this grp with this expertise 

Thanks
09/07/24, 17:24 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: If you're looking for expertise in this area, I can offer some general guidance.

To improve your organization's Glassdoor reviews, consider the following strategies:

1. Encourage employees to share their positive experiences on Glassdoor.
2. Respond promptly and professionally to both positive and negative reviews.
3. Address any concerns or issues raised in negative reviews.
4. Highlight your company culture, benefits, and perks.
5. Share updates and news about your organization.

Let me know if you need any further details around ! I am happy to help :)
09/07/24, 17:24 - Rashi PANDITA HRBP Times Internet: These are good pointers thanks😊

09/07/24, 17:32 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I had taken up this activity in the past when our glassdoor rating started to fall 4.8 to 3.6...

Sometimes when companies take some change mgmt strategic activities this happens. And during that phase much can br done internally. I enquired with many in the network and received these inputs :

- recognize those employees who can be ambassdors to drive positivity, happiness, opportunity in tough times and collaborate with them to drive things both internally and externally
- we weren't even owning the page and we decided to keep it that way
- Reaching out to people who had written negative comments and understand more for their unhappiness and take corrective measures
- if anonymous, reply in the comment section

-	Get your leaders on board to read reviews and fix common problems in the culture; otherwise, your efforts won't matter.
-	Flag negative Glassdoor reviews with valid reasons; about 20% don't meet Glassdoor standards and can be removed.
-	Wait a week for Glassdoor to remove invalid negative reviews, then respond politely to show you care about addressing concerns.
-	Motivate your satisfied employees to leave 5-star reviews on Glassdoor to boost your ratings.
-	Share employee activities and reward pictures on Glassdoor regularly to engage your audience. 
-	Make your workplace happier with fair pay, good benefits, a friendly atmosphere, and opportunities for growth.
-	Simplify the interview and feedback process to ensure a positive candidate experience.
-	Always keep an eye on your Glassdoor ratings and adjust your efforts based on feedback.

Keep in mind, that the key is to make your employees happy, which often results in better ratings.

09/07/24, 19:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Check with legal if India work permit is required even for internship...
09/07/24, 19:49 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: As long as he holds the valid student visa he can take up internship role . I don’t see any legal restrictions around this ! 

But make sure you do proper due diligence of the candidate similarly like BGC .

11/07/24, 09:24 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Have you guys come across a situation in tech hiring where you feel the pool is exhausted and repetitive. If you have faced this problem , how have you solved for this ?
11/07/24, 09:25 - Udita Saini Associate Director Iris Higherground: Yes many times
11/07/24, 09:25 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: How hv u solved for this
11/07/24, 09:26 - +91 99023 29420: Try different souring channels, do passive sourcing, conduct hackathons
11/07/24, 09:26 - +91 99023 29420: Run an employee referral campaign
11/07/24, 09:27 - Udita Saini Associate Director Iris Higherground: Sometimes we have to make clients understand the situation of the market and have clear communication with them regarding the candidates. 

Referrals, different sourcing channels and conducting drives
11/07/24, 09:28 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: This is the protocol I had put in place in my earlier organisation ,it certainly help get talent pool and increase traffic
11/07/24, 09:38 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Very much. When certain roles are being continously in demand in the company, pool that we see in the common portals looks repetitive.
11/07/24, 09:39 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I faced this a lot while hiring full stack RoR and Node devs.
11/07/24, 09:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This is demand and supply in the market. We can add more funnels to improve the top line but yet not sustainable. Buying talent gets challenging. Hence building and developing in a proactive manner needs to be planned. This is what I did👍
11/07/24, 09:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thanks for the input guys
11/07/24, 09:47 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I was just speaking with a senior EM candidate who is being very inflexible for interview scheduling , upon telling him that , he said if you feel I am not interested , let’s drop the candidature and I mutually agreed 
Day already dint start well
11/07/24, 09:48 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I really wish these candidates start respecting recruiters and I know this debate is endless
11/07/24, 09:48 - Rishi Banerjee Associate Director - Talent Acquisition Atlan: Seeing this signal from a lot of EM’s recently. Has the demand for this role increased across the industry last few months?
11/07/24, 09:48 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: But least expected from senior candidates
11/07/24, 09:49 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Are you hiring for an EM Neha ?
11/07/24, 09:50 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: One thing I understand 
- bandwidth concerns across companies , people don’t hv time
11/07/24, 09:50 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yes senior EM
11/07/24, 09:50 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Got any reference Arvind ?
11/07/24, 09:50 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Can’t help Neha ! It happens , In my experience I see 1 such folk out of 10 . Just move on
11/07/24, 09:50 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yup
11/07/24, 09:51 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Sampat I hv to come back to you , will do asap
11/07/24, 09:51 - Arvindh Murthy HR: DMing you
11/07/24, 09:51 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: It sometimes depends on the brand as well. I'm sure, the same EM won't say any such comments for orgs like Microsoft, Intuit etc etc.
11/07/24, 09:51 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Sure :)
11/07/24, 09:51 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Ofcourse only to be considered for those companies also right
11/07/24, 09:52 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: And sometimes it's also how the TA is interacting with a senior candidate. Presentation is very important here. It's not a junior candidate hiring game.
11/07/24, 09:56 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Recruiters must conduct a comprehensive review of a candidate's employment history, including their transition patterns and tenure at previous organizations. This assessment enables recruiters to evaluate the candidate's potential  commitment to the organization. It is essential to perform this analysis during the initial interview to ensure a well-informed hiring decision.
11/07/24, 10:06 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We should command respect yet these incidents too happen and is a learning experience as well. This is something we do, share multiple slots through ATS and ask candidates to select the one that suits them. 
When don't have multiple slots, try to reason out....inside or outside 😀
11/07/24, 10:36 - Suyash Kumar: <Media omitted>
11/07/24, 11:32 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: i know what you mean and thats practiced but you should feel going an extra mile for the candidate. In this case i dint feel like , anyway..
Thanks for suggesting, it helps to know i am not the only one.. just that it gets exhausting dealing internal, external etc

11/07/24, 16:40 - Spoorthi Yogappa Assistant Manager Recruitment Cactus Communication: Guys I have a question. 

One of my friend who joined an XYZ co. Stayed there for a month and wants to leave now and the company is asking to serve 1 month notice or pay 1 month notice. 

So here, he needs to pay the entire 1 month salary or the base pay?
11/07/24, 16:42 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: It’s usually the basic pay
11/07/24, 16:43 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Depends on his negotiations too because if it’s outlined in the policy that it should be a full month salary then that’s how the HR team will persue it
11/07/24, 16:43 - Spoorthi Yogappa Assistant Manager Recruitment Cactus Communication: Right? But those guys r asking him to pay like his entire 1 month salary
11/07/24, 16:43 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Well he can ask for the policy reference in that case
11/07/24, 16:48 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: The appointment letter would have this clause outlined
11/07/24, 16:49 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: It depends on the the organisation’s policy. It’s mostly mentioned clearly in the appointment letters if these amounts are calculated basis basic salary or gross salary
11/07/24, 16:57 - Spoorthi Yogappa Assistant Manager Recruitment Cactus Communication: The appointment letter has nothing mentioned as such. It only says serve 1 month notice
11/07/24, 17:14 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Wasn’t there any probation period?
11/07/24, 17:16 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Please check the termination clause in the offer or Appointment letter and act accordingly. If it is mentioned, then he should serve.
11/07/24, 17:18 - Spoorthi Yogappa Assistant Manager Recruitment Cactus Communication: Itseems it's 6months
11/07/24, 17:22 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Usually under probation, there are lesser number of days
11/07/24, 17:24 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: This may be the case in few companies, if it is there this is the best
11/07/24, 17:24 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Also the best way is to request the manager to relieve him soon
11/07/24, 17:25 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: I would suggest have a smooth exit :) otherwise he may face complications in his further career !
11/07/24, 17:28 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Our clause also states 1 month in probation :)
11/07/24, 17:41 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: I agree, we from the HR/TA community should not advise to look for any loopholes, as the candidates will go and tell that they got details from my HR friend. Just think about the TA who put in so much effort to hire him
11/07/24, 17:55 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Guys anyone planning for campus this year ? <This message was edited>
11/07/24, 17:56 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: What is your approach for engineering colleges ? Do we offer full time offers or intern and convert them based on merit and need?
11/07/24, 18:01 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: I would suggest go with hybrid approach !
11/07/24, 18:01 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: What’s hybrid approach
11/07/24, 18:01 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: 1. Offer a combination of internships and full-time offers based on the student's performance and potential.

   2. Assess intern performance and convert them to full-time offers or extend another internship term for further evaluation.

This is the best practice according to me !!
11/07/24, 18:03 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Dont you think if your need is to approach CAT A college , you may not get better slots if you only go with an intent to hire interns ?
11/07/24, 18:04 - Swapna Kole: I dont think it works like that now
11/07/24, 18:05 - Shivali Shukla Founder NavigoTalent: What’s up?
11/07/24, 18:05 - Swapna Kole: Have you spoken to any colleges recently?

11/07/24, 18:06 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: In that case you can proceed with full time opportunities !
11/07/24, 18:08 - Swapna Kole: What is the purpose of hiring interns, I mean what are you solving for?
11/07/24, 18:14 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Creating a pool for future hiring needs eventually
11/07/24, 18:14 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Mainly at level 1s of any department
11/07/24, 18:14 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Second is ofcourse creating a talent pool within
11/07/24, 18:26 - Swapna Kole: We spoke....

12/07/24, 18:27 - Me: Any news of how many impacted in India?

12/07/24, 18:33 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: May be in 100’s ! Naukri can give ball park numbers !
12/07/24, 18:54 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Really sad news 😔
12/07/24, 18:56 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 1050 labelled as non performers at baseline, 300 made redundant, total 1800
12/07/24, 18:57 - Akshay Kulkarni Jio TA: OMG !!
12/07/24, 18:57 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: That’s sad
12/07/24, 18:57 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: They laid off 1800 to hire 1800 back at new baseline standards
12/07/24, 18:58 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: So layoff is only 300, rest 1500 or so labelled as firings for non performance
12/07/24, 18:58 - Akshay Kulkarni Jio TA: Is this in India alone or is it globally ?
12/07/24, 18:59 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Hiring back in AI and customer team
12/07/24, 18:59 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Not in India
12/07/24, 18:59 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Globally, mostly in US
12/07/24, 18:59 - Akshay Kulkarni Jio TA: Ok
12/07/24, 18:59 - Akshay Kulkarni Jio TA: 1 layoff in US will open 2 Headcounts in India then !!
12/07/24, 18:59 - +91 96207 25533: This is soo bad and unfair, My question with hiring is ... companies can layoff people left right center, they can have , maintain whatever hell like work culture, etc etc ... but still while hiring why do they ask or look at STABILITY in candidate's profile .. i strongly feel its wrong.. hiring should be more and only skill based , behavior based ... not on such stupid reasons .. What are your thoughts , please comment
12/07/24, 18:59 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Google exactly did the same 2 years ago, they termed the layoff as performance basis lay off.
12/07/24, 19:01 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: For US openings? Didn't knew naukri is used there too! 🤣
12/07/24, 19:01 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: None, but folks might look out, as they will be scared
12/07/24, 19:15 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: I was referring to Indian market !
12/07/24, 19:16 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: There's no lay off in India but.
12/07/24, 19:17 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Ok I thought india folks are part of this !
12/07/24, 19:20 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Think about the employer POV, they have be careful of bad actors in the talent pool who will use the layoff excuse to cover for other reasons they were let go of. 
So, I feel if the question of stability is asked the right way it will make sure the candidate understands that the question is a part due diligence on their part.
12/07/24, 19:21 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: I've burnt my own fingers trying to be a good cop and avoiding the erratic employment stints of 2 talents

17/07/24, 09:56 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: dafuq
17/07/24, 09:57 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: we have to maintain candidate pool of 50% kannadigas? how the hell are we in recruiting going to verify if a candidate “is born in the State of Karnataka and who is domiciled in the State for a period of 15 years and who is capable of speaking, reading and writing Kannada in a legible way and has passed a required test conducted by the nodal agency”. <This message was edited>

17/07/24, 10:03 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Kannahire - we have a verified pool of kannadiga candidates who pass the govt mandate and pass your skill test too. <This message was edited>
17/07/24, 10:04 - Arvindh Murthy HR: my understanding is that it is applicable only for mfg setups and not it .. or have I lost the plot ??
17/07/24, 10:05 - Vikram Bhardwaj Director TA Yellow.ai: I also have a similar sense.
17/07/24, 10:05 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Bill mandates industries, factories and “other establishments”. IT setups should come under other? <This message was edited>
17/07/24, 10:05 - Arvindh Murthy HR: damn
17/07/24, 10:06 - Suyash Kumar: This is also adorable considering the different meanings of Kanna in different languages
17/07/24, 10:06 - Vikram Bhardwaj Director TA Yellow.ai: If IT gets on that radar…doomed
17/07/24, 10:06 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: “If local candidates are not available, then industries or establishments can appeal to government for relaxation in provisions”
17/07/24, 10:07 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: so IT setups to campaign together for this?
17/07/24, 10:07 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: There might be an additional process compliance - to check if that skill is not available within Kannadiga, before hiring others. Like how we have in many countries.
17/07/24, 10:07 - Swapna Kole: These are same rules as European countries , they have too their own criteria for applicants.
17/07/24, 10:08 - Suyash Kumar: We'll have to wait it out and see. This is yet to be tabled in Vidhan Soudha.
17/07/24, 10:20 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: I don't think it is applicable for IT and private sector yet. It is suggested for Factories, industries and other establishments like local businesses, restaurants, shops, malls etc. And minimum qualifications doesn't align with Private sector jobs in the bill. However as Suyash mentioned lets wait and watch
17/07/24, 10:28 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: This is similar to many foreign countries. Mostly not applicable to white collar jobs. Even abroad it has to do with more industrious & manufacturing, retail & other setups..
17/07/24, 10:29 - Arvindh Murthy HR: The article kind of implied that na …
17/07/24, 10:29 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: This message was deleted
17/07/24, 10:29 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Consulting would be tough na
17/07/24, 10:30 - Arvindh Murthy HR: They look for very high pedigree kind of folks
17/07/24, 10:30 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: aerospace/consulting won’t fall in either factories/industries/manufacturing or IT. hence my question
17/07/24, 10:31 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: other establishments is deliberately kept abstract
17/07/24, 10:31 - Arvindh Murthy HR: But they can be consulting for these companies/ industries right
17/07/24, 10:32 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Bill will be tabled in assembly tomorrow, so let’s see
17/07/24, 10:48 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yes it's always intentional so that broader scope (if required) is easy to put through
17/07/24, 10:48 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yeah no sense getting worked up on this currently..
17/07/24, 10:51 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Similar law in Gurgaon got scrapped so don't think it will get passed
17/07/24, 10:51 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Got a query from this - a remote person in guwahati working for bangalore company. which govt collects his income tax - assam or karnataka? state he lives in or state his company is in?
17/07/24, 10:53 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Assam buddy
17/07/24, 10:55 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: It might get passed in Karnataka , there is high probability. No party will oppose as they may lose vote share...
But I have some basic Qs, Has the Govt studied on what is the current % share in these industries, what are the competencies required to hire such Talent, is it available in Kannadigas.. If Kannadigas has the competency and missing opportunities here then study other reasons for it...Simply putting such laws will only put Karnataka in bad light in attracting business and investments! Its already low now...Hope some sensible discussion happens in the assembly.
17/07/24, 10:56 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: This is because the individual's income is deemed to have been received in Assam, and therefore, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Assam tax authorities.
17/07/24, 10:56 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Its Karnataka. Companies will pay taxes in the state they are located and not where the employee are <This message was edited>

17/07/24, 11:20 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: For TDS i dont think the individual have any option to decide which state they pay tax to. As anyway the Income tax goes to central government and not the state government. So work from anywhere the income tax goes to central Income tax department under central government.
17/07/24, 11:21 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Our company is registered in Blore. We have people working across the country.  Company deducts tds and pays it to karnataka state. Company pays Professional tax to karnataka state only. We are not paying to so many other states where employees reside.
17/07/24, 11:21 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: PT is state tax

17/07/24, 11:29 - Mehvish K HR Head Travelwings: Hi Basant,

In general of course, you can encourage hiring managers to assess the current diversity ratio of their teams and if they have the choice between candidates of similar calibre then fill the position to ensure diversity. 

Proactive way to do this is to run a selective *Leadership Program* to strengthen your current staff and ensure women/ diverse groups get representation as decision makers. Parallel to this, you can run a diversity/ women *Allyship Program* to train the managers of the selected group to also encourage and allow more autonomy among diverse groups and nurture their growth. This would be like a mirror program to the leadership one. 

Diversity is not necessarily having representation across various groups, it is also that no matter your background, your skill set is all that matters. This is a generic training that everyone could do as a part of onboarding checklist.
17/07/24, 11:42 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: PT is state but rest is central
17/07/24, 11:51 - Talha Tahir Associate Director Recruitment FIS: Disastrous

17/07/24, 14:35 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Another political Gimmick by the Rulers, very well knowing that the decision will be struck down by the Apex Court.Its all about deriving short term political benefits, at the petty cost of deprived masses.

17/07/24, 14:45 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: Those states also proposed but it couldn't be implemented as got quashed in the court. Such short sighted decisions are very difficult to implement and may not yield results they hope for and only very short term political gain. Let's hope for the best though.
17/07/24, 14:48 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: It’s Saturday right ?
17/07/24, 14:49 - Suyash Kumar: <Media omitted>
17/07/24, 14:50 - Aman Agrawal HRT Consultant KPMG: Not proposed. It is a law there. Check online.
17/07/24, 14:56 - Kshitij Gupta Lead TA Global Pixis. Ai: I did check, Its only limited to C and D grade roles in limited industries and factories and not highly skilled and and other private sector roles. Here also if it is limited to the C and D grade roles it may get implemented but the proposal is not just limited to that and there are other unclear and open ended demands to it which may not get go ahead. Due to similar reasons it was quashed in Haryana (Gurgaon) as shared by someone earlier.
17/07/24, 14:58 - Suyash Kumar: At the moment anything related to this bill is pure speculation
17/07/24, 14:58 - Suyash Kumar: Let's see what information unfolds over the coming days

18/07/24, 07:23 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Fascinating how the media and a few LinkedIn influencers are fear mongering.

What are the local unions asking for? 
Implementation of Sarojini Mahishi report of 1989 which suggested reservation in Group C and D jobs in Government and Private sectors.

What is Group C and D?

Group C - Operations, Field work and clerical jobs
Group D - Peons, Gatekeepers, sweepers and semi skilled labours

Why is this demand being made?
The argument is that a majority of Private firms acquired land in the state after converting it from an agricultural plot, this is an opportunity cost for the locals. Hence the move is to balance out the situation.


I hope you'll make your own conclusions based on the above naunces. Also, there is a chance that the courts will strike the bill down and state Congress blames opposition for the stunt.
18/07/24, 08:34 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Sure Archana , we can connect !
18/07/24, 08:37 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Nobody is fear mongering, only discussing 🙂. Full bill has 100% in group C & D, and then 50 & 75 in mgmt (group A) and non-mgmt (Group B) roles respectively. Nobody has problems in C & D, it’s only for B & A.
18/07/24, 08:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Either way, with the backlash the govt has already put it on hold. As many here said, won’t get passed most likely
18/07/24, 09:20 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This problem can't be solved by reservation and even now if kannadigas apply for jobs and they have the required skills and in the budgets why would they be denied of jobs. 
Because of shortage of people we find lot of illegal immigrants taking up those jobs. Atleast in this group who understand the business and talent scope, let's do the RCA and come out with solutions.
18/07/24, 09:23 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: As simple as house construction workers,earlier I used to find north karnataka people doing those jobs in Blore in their non agriculture season, they are there today but numbers are less. Reason, yes they too have taken up education seriously and taken up other jobs. 
So there is a different problem in hiring in these sectors.  A friend of mine who was running unplan has to scale down his operations due to lack of people to take up such operational jobs. Not only C and D, it had reservation propsed in other categories as well. And yes I am a kannadiga and very well know such reservation are anti productive not the real solutions. It will only make business pay fine , running business becomes difficult <This message was edited>
18/07/24, 09:32 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: Interesting...I've seen Emversity trying to make allied health service roles aspirational, that's one way of of solving demand and quality supply of talent. We'll need more creative ways and a lot more hands on deck.
18/07/24, 09:58 - Ankur Kayesth Masai: Lot of debate on the topic. This video breaks the issue down very clearly and objectively. Watch it for an in depth understanding of the issue and where it is likely to go

19/07/24, 06:14 - Vikram Bhardwaj Director TA Yellow.ai: Hey Shiv, We can connect. Am into remote set up for last 5 yrs
19/07/24, 09:12 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: No diversity in the panel! Is this not a thought big Orgs give to when they do these events?
19/07/24, 09:32 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Blore is in the global map for different reasons. Also these bills are for companies where there some kind of subsidy from govt. Harayana bill was kept on hold by court
19/07/24, 09:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We always benchmark to the better ones not otherwise right? Bar risers are not just for interviews
19/07/24, 09:38 - Swapna Kole: Happy finally someone noticed it 😁
19/07/24, 09:41 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: I belong to a diversity group, maybe that's why :)
19/07/24, 09:46 - Swapna Kole: That's great :) but what about the rest of the members of this group 🙈 . Does a man need to be apart of Diversity group to observe it 😎 (sorry for being straight here, I am not a feminist but believe in equality😛)  not trying to hurt anyones sentiments and believe 🙏
19/07/24, 09:47 - Suyash Kumar: So I can talk about it from an event organiser's perspective.
19/07/24, 09:48 - Suyash Kumar: At the moment, it's definitely not a good look
19/07/24, 09:49 - Suyash Kumar: The lack of diversity from the organiser's side could be for 2 reason:
1. They're still in the middle of getting confirmations from other invited speakers. It takes quite a bit of time 
2. They really didn't think about the diversity angle at all
19/07/24, 09:49 - Suyash Kumar: I'm hoping it's the former
19/07/24, 09:49 - Suyash Kumar: We'll find out in the coming days
19/07/24, 09:50 - Suyash Kumar: Otherwise, like I said, it's a bad look
19/07/24, 09:50 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: @⁨Nimesh Mathur Haptik HR⁩ has already raised this on one of his linkedin posts! Kudos to him. @⁨Nimesh Mathur Haptik HR⁩ pls share your post here
19/07/24, 09:51 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: There’s never an excuse to make it happen no! Especially in HR where the diversity ratio is favourable

20/07/24, 14:34 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Diversity is only limited to man and woman in the panel ? Just curious 🤔 <This message was edited>
20/07/24, 14:59 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If there were all women in the panel, we would have praised the same initiative with lots of appreciations. There wouldn't  have been any diversity debate, right?  People in the panel coming from different industries, different org cultures wouldn't they contribute to diversity factor? Just thinking aloud. Let's break the diversity factors beyond the gender only?

Any input will be highly appreciated. Please free to DM.

TIA.

Can anyone help me with the current market budget for an SDE 1 Android role with an experience range of 1-3 years, including both fixed and variable components? We're conducting a compensation review and need the ranges specifically from fintech startups.

Thanks!

24/07/24, 13:05 - Niket Gupta TA Head Yubi: what is the source of this report
24/07/24, 13:07 - Niket Gupta TA Head Yubi: & what is the variable % one can assume
24/07/24, 13:09 - Ajesh Nair MyGate TA: 10% maybe
24/07/24, 13:11 - Ajesh Nair MyGate TA: Thanks Dipesh
24/07/24, 13:12 - Dipesh Jain AVP Talent Elevation Capital: yes it varies co. to co. and levels, largely 10-15%. Some cos. may not even have a variable for tech functions for early/mid levels
24/07/24, 13:15 - Dipesh Jain AVP Talent Elevation Capital: Hi Niket, we at Elevation, did a compensation survey last year across 200+ early/growth stage startups for tech and non tech functions and came up with this benchmark.

24/07/24, 13:19 - Ajesh Nair MyGate TA: Understood
24/07/24, 13:46 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: I still think we shouldn't discuss politics though. About one or the other government being elected etc. Think that should be completely avoided at least in this forum. There are WhatsApp communities where such discussions are prevalent but my perspective is that we avoid it there. I'm sure there would be supporters of every single party & this can just get murky!
24/07/24, 13:48 - Me: Definitely
24/07/24, 14:52 - Ajesh Nair MyGate TA: This really helps, Dipesh. Thank you so much!

Here is the report 😳

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/careercoachgskumar_intel-layoffs-technology-activity-7224431945462468608-BQoW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android
31/07/24, 21:45 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Intel layoffs , never heard 🤔
31/07/24, 21:47 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Inmobi also did,  but no1 came to know about it. 

Cisco also does, no1 knows about it.
31/07/24, 21:48 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Everyone does this. It's no more news is what I've realised 😂
31/07/24, 21:49 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Cisco I heard about it
31/07/24, 21:50 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Industry seems to be going worse ...what's happening really? Who is doing well? Who is recovering?
31/07/24, 21:53 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: It was hard business lines last year but right now many companies are laying off to mask poor leadership and decision making from last couple years that have compounded into a big net negative
31/07/24, 21:53 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: “Shoring up business focus and realignment of finances” you’ll see this term common in such announcements
31/07/24, 21:54 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: They’re just buying time in order to turn things around
31/07/24, 21:54 - Nitin Dhar TA 2070 Health: The worst was Linkedin layoffs.😂🤣😂.. How in the world were there business going down!!😂🤣😂
31/07/24, 21:55 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Lean teams!
31/07/24, 21:55 - Nitin Dhar TA 2070 Health: True that.. More like fortifying our present to overcome future challenges!! 


Just another bs statements!!
31/07/24, 21:55 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: This is my observation and understanding, open to be corrected as I hope to be corrected with a deeper explanation that disproves my POV. I don’t like many of us are so uncertain it shakes up our belief systems
31/07/24, 21:55 - Nitin Dhar TA 2070 Health: More like monkey sees monkey does!! 😂😂😂
31/07/24, 21:59 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: A remote company forcing folks back to office. R&D and innovation product teams getting eliminated. Then advanced development teams going into maintenance mode. Then performance cuts. Then cost cutting measures (office lunch toning down), Etc etc. it’s a drill you can observe now to predict such incoming news <This message was edited>

31/07/24, 22:02 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: This was also announced in Dec 2023 FYI and even 2022 if I'm not wrong from what I heard from one of the Directors at Intel directly
31/07/24, 22:12 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Hi folks is there anyone who has worked on obtaining ISO certification ?I would need some help in this in understanding the process in depth
31/07/24, 22:31 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Have done it but we there are multiple ISO certifications. Are you referring to a specific one? Also you need to use a vendor to complete this. All big 4s do it plus there are some smaller vendors..
31/07/24, 22:33 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Yes 9001 is something that would fit us
31/07/24, 22:33 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Is there a difference if we get it done through smaller vendors compared to big4’s!
31/07/24, 22:40 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: It’s the ease of getting the license
31/07/24, 22:41 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Got it thank you!
31/07/24, 22:51 - Bhavya Arora TTD: I work for Sprinto and we help in ensuring you are audit ready. Let me know if that helps, I can introduce you to the Sales team
31/07/24, 22:51 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Sounds good! I would definitely would like to get connected
31/07/24, 23:11 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Other alternatives as well (picked from the net) although I have worked with Scrut in the past & big 4 orgs...

Vanta
Scrut Automation
Secureframe
Drata
AuditBoard
Thoropass
Scytale
Wiz
31/07/24, 23:13 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Thanks Clive! Did Scrut held up to your expectations in implementations?
31/07/24, 23:14 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: It's the same as insurance TPAs. The newer providers are trying to create a platform experience but when it comes to grass roots, the older players are really strong with their subject. From getting discounts, to including lives even though they were not insured on time. They are able to influence decision makers. However slowly the newer players are starting to find their grounding..
31/07/24, 23:16 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Honestly none do for me 😂.. I've realised you need to know what you want. Research & ask them questions & also push them to include whatever you want/need
31/07/24, 23:17 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Even with a big 4. They will give you templates that are completely outdated. Same with the smaller players. This was my overall experience even through demos.
31/07/24, 23:17 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: So before you decide. Ask them to provide you a framework of what they would do. What they need from you. Do you own research. Get things in place etc...
31/07/24, 23:18 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Quite commercialised approach!! Looks quite vast when I researched not sure how the templates help <This message was edited>
31/07/24, 23:20 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Got it..!! thank you very much these are very helpful
31/07/24, 23:26 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Everything is. It's a business at the end of the day. Given @⁨Bhavya Arora TTD⁩ can help you connect with Sprinto, maybe start there & then take next steps cautiously.
31/07/24, 23:27 - Samar Banu Sr. HR Specialist Betsol: Sure, will do that..
01/08/24, 10:20 - Mitchell Dudani TA Wildcraft: Hello everyone.. Has anyone heard of any app / chrome extension for below..

05/08/24, 15:23 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: SocialTalent
05/08/24, 16:16 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hi All
I have one question.
An employee joined us on Monday, took WFH on Tuesday, and came to the office on Wednesday. Thursday again this person did not come to the office and said they would like to move out and did not work after that. So technically, they worked for only 3 days.

Is the person eligible for any salary? Apparently, they feel that they should be paid for their contributions within 3 days of joining.
05/08/24, 16:18 - Santhosh Arni Ravi Assistant Manager HR AtoS: Depends on the induction process
05/08/24, 16:18 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: As in?
05/08/24, 16:19 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: yes I agree
05/08/24, 16:19 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: if they have already started contributing to the projects or 
are stillin process of learning about the company and policies n ol then nope
05/08/24, 16:20 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: how do you think an employee can start contributing from the day 1 or 2. And they left by their own choice. The company also invested time in them for those 3 days.
05/08/24, 16:23 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: exactly my point they cannot contribute anything in 3 days .. then what contribution exactly is he/she asking for.. 


you can ask them to send you a doc specifying what contributions they did in those 3 days for which they are demanding money ... 😅😅
05/08/24, 16:27 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: that is a good idea. 😅
05/08/24, 16:28 - Santhosh Arni Ravi Assistant Manager HR AtoS: Company side , one IC same day happened? WFM and WC also include?
05/08/24, 16:28 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Sorry, I did not get any of these short forms.
05/08/24, 16:29 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: If your termination clause says regarding the Notice Period. Ask the employee to pay for the Notice period buyout or serve the notice period. Then they will not ask
05/08/24, 16:30 - Santhosh Arni Ravi Assistant Manager HR AtoS: Induction done from company end and individual role and work force management and work culture happened on the same day?
05/08/24, 16:31 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Yes, we face candidates who think they are smart... we need to time and again prove that we are smarter then them
05/08/24, 16:31 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: absolutely.
05/08/24, 16:31 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: <Media omitted>
05/08/24, 16:31 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: And generally any candidate takes almost a week just to settl in and understand the work 
even if its IC
05/08/24, 16:32 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: If you are BAD.... Im your DAD! <This message was edited>
05/08/24, 16:32 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: so it would be good if you can loop in their manager and ask them to send you a detailed list of their contributions and ask the manager to verify them if it has been done
05/08/24, 16:32 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: only then we can think of paying
05/08/24, 16:32 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: 😅🤣🤣
05/08/24, 16:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: More than all this, find out why this case happened? Plan how to mitigate this risk.

Have you given company assets already and put him/her to any project ? Does he/she wants relieving letter too? How would they show these 3 days job in their career story ? Just curious🤓
05/08/24, 16:44 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Santhosh, we are a small-scale startup and we don't have any such induction program.
05/08/24, 16:45 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: That's my point. He feels he has contributed and company has taken that for free. I mean seriously.
05/08/24, 16:46 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I had faced a similar case in the past in for a senior role but respectfully departed without any financial traumas
05/08/24, 16:47 - Santhosh Arni Ravi Assistant Manager HR AtoS: Before his and her joining they are aware right? Now they have their own idea
05/08/24, 16:47 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Yeah, I mean I did not expect him to come back and ask for the same as it was given that how can any company pay you for 3 days out of which you came late to the office 2 days and did WFH one day.
05/08/24, 16:47 - Santhosh Arni Ravi Assistant Manager HR AtoS: Kindly implement WFM and IC
05/08/24, 17:51 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: What’s your notice period clause and absconding clause says in offer letter  ? Act accordingly .
05/08/24, 18:17 - +65 9068 5421: If any of you are interested

05/08/24, 19:55 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Hi Guys, 

Could you help me in a situation? We have increments going on and we have an employee absolutely creating a ruckus, we have also been giving warnings, but that has improved but performance has gone down. 

Now if we give 0% increment, it can cause negativity. What to do?
05/08/24, 19:56 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: How bad is the ruckus? Talking bad to fellow employees or sabotaging the project?
05/08/24, 19:57 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Talking bad.
05/08/24, 19:57 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: To start with
05/08/24, 19:57 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: About the company
05/08/24, 19:58 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: not all ready to take work pressure and taunting managers and HR'son every decision.
05/08/24, 19:58 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: You will need to cut ties. Whether you do it in short term or long term (1 month or 6 months), it will happen.
05/08/24, 19:58 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Whether by your choice or their choice
05/08/24, 19:58 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: I soo agree. 

But doing it during increments feels wrong!
05/08/24, 20:02 - Ipshita Ray HR Ops Specialist Tricog: It is but then other employees are also getting affected. I mean if he is spreading negative talks to employees, chances are you also lose those employees (ofcourse not during increment but they could also cause a ruckus because of not being happy)
05/08/24, 20:02 - Ipshita Ray HR Ops Specialist Tricog: Or have a talk with the employee
05/08/24, 20:03 - Bhavya Arora TTD: Generally in such cases we give them hike as per the inflation (match the inflation percentage) and after having the conversation we either put them on PIP or ask them to leave. <This message was edited>
05/08/24, 20:03 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: I was planning to defer the increment. But even that can cause negativity.
05/08/24, 20:03 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: And check performance for 3 months.
05/08/24, 20:04 - Ipshita Ray HR Ops Specialist Tricog: Was he performing well before ?
05/08/24, 20:04 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Umm, yes! Kind off Average.
05/08/24, 20:04 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: for 3 months.
05/08/24, 20:04 - Rajesh Muralidharan Recruitment Manager Capgemini: Assess 1 year performance and you can decide as appropriate
05/08/24, 20:05 - Ipshita Ray HR Ops Specialist Tricog: In my opinion, PIP or straight termination.
05/08/24, 20:06 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Not strong enough grounds for straight termination
05/08/24, 20:06 - Rajesh Muralidharan Recruitment Manager Capgemini: What's the value add
What was his contribution for the last 1 year
Attitude issue and team collaboration 
Short term and long term impact of having him or losing him
05/08/24, 20:06 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: No impact, we already have removed all tasks
05/08/24, 20:06 - Rajesh Muralidharan Recruitment Manager Capgemini: Must build a clear cut case with sufficient proof
05/08/24, 20:07 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Problem only stands at the negativity, since we are just having 15 employees in this location.
05/08/24, 20:07 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: termination seems a bit too much for now!
05/08/24, 20:08 - Rajesh Muralidharan Recruitment Manager Capgemini: May be, think of garden leave
05/08/24, 20:08 - Ipshita Ray HR Ops Specialist Tricog: What is garden leave?
05/08/24, 20:08 - Rajesh Muralidharan Recruitment Manager Capgemini: Garden leave is a transition period for employees who give or are given notice of termination, keeping them on the payroll but away from the workplace. Under the leave, employees are prohibited from working for the competition or themselves.
05/08/24, 20:09 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Letting go with severance where they don’t work <This message was edited>
05/08/24, 20:57 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: From the compliance POV, you should do the FnF..
05/08/24, 21:04 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: I mean, this is clearly an absconding case. Send trigger and terminate. So that u have this in your record as well. 

Post termination, calculate the recovery basis Notice Period and pay off the balance (if any) - Within 45 days

Make sure you have an exit policy stating such terminations as well.

Over the past few months, I've been experiencing issues with LinkedIn Recruiter. Even when I post junior roles like Intern or SDR, the applicant pool has been surprisingly small. Typically, we receive a high volume of applications for these positions, but lately, the numbers have been significantly lower.

Is anyone else encountering similar issues?
Thanks

14/08/24, 06:56 - Tejaswi Vajinepalli Asst. Manager HRBP LEAD: This is not to be followed especially from recruitment standpoint, the metrics here are totally different like square foot per each individual student, how many different streams are there, facilities wise, infrastructure wise, this ranking is made on a whole number of parameters which are not streamlined to the quality of education or quality of students.
14/08/24, 06:58 - Tejaswi Vajinepalli Asst. Manager HRBP LEAD: The best thing would be go to a CAT training institute website like TIME, they provide better ranking in terms of placement statistics, stream wise. That would give a clear idea of which talent pool to be preferred.

Does anyone have experience with recruitment and managing the employee lifecycle in Dubai? We’re setting up an entity and hiring employees for the first time, and I’d love to learn about your experiences and processes.

Please DM me or connect me with someone who can help (I am reachable at +91 9060071002). I’d really appreciate any support. Thanks!
14/08/24, 11:20 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: I am open to connecting with vendors who have good exposure in bulk hiring.
we are looking to hire 50 folks on monthly basis.
14/08/24, 11:31 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: This is too less. For tech it should be 50k & above, for non tech 30k and above. Kickers for diversity (or something else) if valued in your company
14/08/24, 11:32 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: this is good for interns
14/08/24, 11:34 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: in my last company, for a successful referral, bonus used to be around 1 lac. and in similars orgs, i have heard it to be around 2-5 lacs as well.
14/08/24, 11:35 - Siddarth Praneeth TA Specialist Akrivia: Please let us know the company name 😅😂
14/08/24, 11:35 - Muskan Pasrija TA Specialist OfBusiness: +1 😂
14/08/24, 11:36 - Niket Gupta TA Head Yubi: We also were paying this kind of amount but then we have to stop it completely
14/08/24, 11:36 - Ivy Das TA Leader PhonePe: +1
14/08/24, 11:36 - Niket Gupta TA Head Yubi: Not a sustainable thing on long run
14/08/24, 11:36 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: HFT firms are still paying like this <This message was edited>
14/08/24, 11:37 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Ya. We were giving flat 35k till mid level and senior roles 75 to 1 L
14/08/24, 11:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: At Unacademy we had 75k-1.2L for tech (seniority wise) and women kicker was 2x. So a women EM referral would net you a cool 2.4L. Non tech roles started at 40-80k with same kicker
14/08/24, 11:38 - Siddarth Praneeth TA Specialist Akrivia: I can't imagine the toll it would've taken on the recruiters at such companies 😅. Being bombarded with referrals on all fronts with all sorts of profiles. <This message was edited>

16/08/24, 11:44 - Simar RR: Hello everyone,

I'm seeking advice on transitioning from a service-based IT background to product-based Talent Acquisition roles in Bengaluru. The good news is that I've been able to clear multiple interview rounds up to the final stage in both (Startups and Product Based firms) but my lack of direct product hiring experience and the perceived learning curve have been the reason of rejection. 

For those who have made this transition, could you share what strategies helped you overcome these challenges? 

Specifically:

- How did you convey your adaptability for product hiring roles?

- What transferable skills did you highlight from your service-based experience?

- What upskilling resources or approaches did you find most effective?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. 

Feel free to DM. 

Thank you! <This message was edited>

21/08/24, 15:51 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: whats the general policy if an employee breaks the company laptop screen (assigned to him) by mistake
21/08/24, 15:53 - Yaswanth Goteti Head Of People Fincent: He should bear the repair cost if not in warranty
21/08/24, 15:53 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Has the company taken the insurance on the Laptop?
21/08/24, 15:54 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Usually I advise the company to take insurance
21/08/24, 15:55 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: If not check the cost of the repair from the vendor
21/08/24, 15:55 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: in our case, its a almost 2 year old laptop now. so warranty period is over.

just wanted to know since whatever we do now, will become policy
21/08/24, 15:56 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Then if he/She is your employee who has been with you and is a good performer, I recommend you pay
21/08/24, 15:56 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: And you have mentioned that it is by mistake
21/08/24, 15:57 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: And the Laptop is already 2 years OLD
21/08/24, 15:58 - Jay Cred hR: yeh bhej de 🥲 https://youtu.be/2uOZbmbIHDA?feature=shared
21/08/24, 16:00 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: Generally, the repair cost will be recovered.
21/08/24, 16:04 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: makes sense
21/08/24, 16:05 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: If it is severely damaged, you can tell the employee we can split.
21/08/24, 16:06 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Which does not make a lot of sense, as a 2 year OLD Laptop is almost valued ZERO
21/08/24, 16:06 - Yaswanth Goteti Head Of People Fincent: As you said rightly anything you do will become a policy. 

IMO - the cost should be recovered and it sets expectations to the rest to be cautious.  If employee good, tenure and perf then reward in other means
21/08/24, 16:08 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: i was thinking of something like 50-50 or 70(employer)-30 (employee). this way, employees will be cautious always
21/08/24, 16:09 - Yaswanth Goteti Head Of People Fincent: Yeah recover, split I'll leave it to you. They shouldn't think you do anything wrong and company back you up 😊
21/08/24, 16:10 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: You pay for one, you pay for all. But ideally if this is the first case, then you should determine the frequency of this happening & the impact to revenue. 

If under insurance it was covered but outside warranty, then employee had to pay. We had close to 10k employees. Was not possible to bear costs and frequency was there
21/08/24, 16:11 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: So use multiple data points to make a decision you can bear
21/08/24, 16:12 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: I agree with Clive, but in Startups, retaining a good employee is very crucial and to find a replacement in case they leave is much expensive
21/08/24, 16:13 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: so the thing is that we have always been employee friendly. but we have never seen any of them reciprocating that (except for 1-2 folks). thats the reason, I am thinking for a split model
21/08/24, 16:13 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Larger companies have policies for these, but in startups it can be tailor made
21/08/24, 16:13 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yeah, if you have 100-200 employees, then yeah, these cases would ideally be infrequent and hence it's ok to bear
21/08/24, 16:14 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: What's the employee strength? How many times has this happened? 

And there seems to be a larger issue you need to actually solve for if your goodwill is not reciprocated
21/08/24, 16:14 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: 1 laptop cost doesnt effect us for sure. but employees misuse that a lot
21/08/24, 16:17 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: No Sachin, I dont think So
21/08/24, 16:17 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Please check the data as Clive mentioned
21/08/24, 16:18 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: I would suggest, pls recover. We did this for a small company. Employees should take care of their laptops. Employers should instill it as well. If the employee feels it is too much to bear it in one month, have options to spread it out. I did this once for a very small org. I remember other employee in that team started using a good laptop bag to take care of the Mac. It is to do with behavioural change.
21/08/24, 16:18 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: How many times have you paid
21/08/24, 16:28 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Agreed—for now, the company can cover the bill, which can then be recovered in upcoming payrolls, ensuring that high repair costs don't become a burden on the employee or a potential reason for them to leave.

I'm happy to hop on a call or set up some time if you could share your knowledge in this regard.

Thanks,
Shiv

23/08/24, 15:14 - Anupam Srivastava Reltio: It purely depends on company policy. If there are one of the case company can decide to take the cost. Ideally it should be paid by the employees but I am sure IT policy will have this part of it.

27/08/24, 07:12 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Guys - I want to know if there are folks who have been successful in controlling offer drop outs to a certain extent . It has come to a point that it has become a double sword - business refuses to hire anyone with more than 30 days notice and if they are serving notice , thn they are offer shopping . Like how are you all dealing with this
27/08/24, 07:32 - Shruti Goyal Associate Manager TA Aidetic: It’s a matter of concern I believe for everyone of us.
I have been dealing with this issue and it’s uncontrollable.
What I usually prefer is those candidates who are immediate joiners are given first priority.
27/08/24, 07:34 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: Very common problem even with referrals (friends of my employees). Part of me wants to put their name on linkedin and shame them cause they have been dishonest. Nothing you can do. Like Shruti said, prioritise early joiners, no candidates with 90days notice.
27/08/24, 07:43 - Fireside Sayana Dutta: There is other side of the story too where candidates are ghosted. Recruiters promise interviews and then simoly stop receiving the messages and calls of people. Candidates call from other numbers to know that someone else who have applied earlier are being considered or the position is no more relevant because the requirement have changed.
27/08/24, 07:44 - Fireside Sayana Dutta: Overall recruitment is very much broken.
27/08/24, 07:45 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: So basically no solution
27/08/24, 07:45 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: 90 days we don’t give , but they are refusing 60 days also
27/08/24, 07:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: it’s just become such a nuisance now
27/08/24, 07:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Referrals also don’t work
27/08/24, 07:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I agree
27/08/24, 07:49 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Neha - Tap resources from consultancy they might have few resources available on immediate basis ! I know one vendor if you need I can share Contact .
27/08/24, 07:51 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: The best medicine to control renege is to tap quality resources and ensure we do triple layered check before releasing offer . 
Ideally for one position we need keep one or two more selections as a buffer . This will help to certain extent to control the damage .
27/08/24, 07:53 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Also Enable pofu process ..
27/08/24, 07:53 - Suma Gururaj Sr. Manager TA LendingKart: To identify quality resources and to tap passive candidates ( hoping decline chances are less) it takes time and business always puts these positions as P0.
27/08/24, 07:54 - Muthu Karuppan Co-founder Taglynk: When we present only immediate joiners or candidates with gaps of 3 months to a year, some hiring stakeholders refuse to interview them. They often say that I'm always providing these types of profiles, rushing to close the role. However, some stakeholders are happy to accept them. This is a day-to-day challenge we face until the candidate actually checks in at the office.
27/08/24, 07:54 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: This message was deleted
27/08/24, 08:10 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Do you share prospect key achievements while submitting the profiles ?
27/08/24, 08:11 - Muthu Karuppan Co-founder Taglynk: Yes
27/08/24, 08:58 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Hello Neha, I have extensively worked on this and have been quite successful. Happy to help
27/08/24, 09:09 - Vikas Sawant Sr. TA CommerceIQ: Hi Neha,

I guess the challenge is there in both immediate joiner and 30 days notice period,both sides of people will make the best of the situation by taking a counter offers.
What personally have helped me getting that trust from candidate in first call by pitching transparently,if candidate is from same city get them for f2f atleast for last few rounds more effective that virtual. <This message was edited>
27/08/24, 09:09 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Company where i waz heading people function waz runnning both services and product verticals , both in different tech stack. We had rolled out offers to people with 90 days NP. There were hardly any dropouts! It all  starts from how passionately we as recruiters position the opportunity that matches with their career aspirations and yes having a good buffer plan. 

Immediate joinerz and quality is not always matching...so building a strong talent pipeline is crucial. 

I also openly told people to inform me if their mind changes as we depend on them and practically need time to search again. People have informed as well in couple of tumes.

So its about having multiple ways to ensure talent availability to business, which suits your geography, culture , role and growth opportunities. <This message was edited>
27/08/24, 09:25 - Athish Sagar Marchanda HR TBC1: + having backup candidates until the offered person walks through the office doors on DOJ is heavily underrated
27/08/24, 09:37 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: This really depends if the company can afford back ups in the worst case if everyone joins <This message was edited>
27/08/24, 09:37 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Absolutely. We were hiring tech leads for our product vertical and we had 3 final selections.  We still might fail here as we have rolled out offer only to one. If he doesn't join and the other 2 are not available, we again reach to 0. So if budgets and team structures permit, roll out for 2, also have identify internal potential candidate pipeline and build them
27/08/24, 09:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yes budget and appetite if you hv an additional joiner
27/08/24, 09:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thank you
Here we have the refusal
To accept higher notice period let alone offering them
27/08/24, 09:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Rest have been following still at 60% offer to join
27/08/24, 09:39 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: And Hiring manager should also plan for dropout scenario impact on projects and how to mitigate it <This message was edited>

28/08/24, 14:15 - Rashida Sr. HR Generalist Applocum: Hello everyone,

I have one query. One of our core employee is on notice period and he would be joining our potential competitor so in that scenario what steps can be taken that our company's IT and other confidential matters are not exposed. We do make them sign NDA so how can he be held accountable in worst case scenario?
28/08/24, 14:16 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Hello Rashida, According to Law, you cannot do anything
28/08/24, 14:17 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Just make sure, you mention a line in the relieving letter reminding him about the clause in the NDA

29/08/24, 10:27 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: While they might be a core employee, when you state that you are trying to protect you IT & other confidential data, how much of this data is present with the employee? Ideally I'm guessing everything is created on official company assets & not on any employees personal drive. If you have the right security protocols, you data should remain intact. 

Coming to confidential data, many times what we presume is confidential is not considered the same in the court of law. 

It's actually near to impossible for someone to replicate exactly what another org is doing, coz every founder wants a differentiated offering. And growth of revenue is not only due to your product but also the actual service output.

29/08/24, 13:04 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: Anyone here has shared data with Comp Up? How’s the experience of using the data for benchmarking?
29/08/24, 13:15 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: They are accurate and have large data for certain roles - Engg, product etc. Not accurate for CS roles. The advantage is that it is updated regularly. Not sure about the updation as I used it for a limited time. 

Overall, recommend the free service as a support for your existing setup and not a standalone solution.
29/08/24, 13:21 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: Thanks Prapti,  the issue I have with Mercers and Aons is the data ends up being quite wide. Yes it's an outcome of the basket you choose, but the output dosent corroborate with hiring data. Exploring it ..will see. Would love to hear from others experience as well.
29/08/24, 13:23 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Even I don’t recommend for CS roles , it differs a lot .
29/08/24, 13:32 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: The comp survey reports are broad range. one has to use this data and arrive at median /midpoint to work on your own internal benchmarki. Use last 2 years of budget- merit cycle data for references
29/08/24, 13:32 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: CS is customer service?
29/08/24, 13:33 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: Customer Success - per my understanding
29/08/24, 13:33 - Vaibhav Dalal Sr. Director HR nference: True Aprna, sometime it’s hard to convince business just on the basis of comp reports. I know basis hiring where ranges should land. A report just provides a stamp of validation

01/09/24, 06:32 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Good morning everyone,
I am approaching this experienced cohort with a challenge Iam facing. 
Ours is a 10 years old start up company. Till last year we had unlimited leave policy, which means there was no cap on max number of day of leave and likewise we did not have leave encashment or leave carry forward.

As we are now scaling and we have around 250 employees, our founders decided to implement a cap on leave and introduced a new policy with around 24 days leave including  casual leave and sick leave. As a result, people started asking about leave encashment and leave carry forward. 
Though we have a HRMS where people are supposed to apply for leave to ensure we have a record of leave taken by each employee, the culture is yet to grow and managers are not enforcing application of leave before proceeding on leave. Further, as we have flexible working hours and compensatory offs we dont intend to allow leave encashment or carry forward.

My queries to you all:
1.⁠ ⁠Is it mandatory by any law to have leave encashment or leave carry carry forward or is it a company policy matter?
2.⁠ ⁠If I revert back to unlimited leave policy and if an employee resigns , is he entitled to leave encashment? 

Looking forward to your advice folks
Regards and thanks in advance🙏
01/09/24, 06:40 - Akshay Kulkarni Jio TA: Dear Chinmaya. Happy Sunday 🌞

Please refer to the below link for everything about Leave Encashments. May be of some help to you.

https://www.zoho.com/in/payroll/academy/payroll-administration/leave-encashment.html#:~:text=Leave%20encashment%20refers%20to%20the,forward%20to%20the%20next%20year.
01/09/24, 07:07 - Harika Velaga RR: Good morning Chinmaya. Leave encashment is not mandatory. It is a firms decision if they want to provide this benefit or not.
01/09/24, 07:51 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If you understand leave policies according to labour law, emoyees earn 1 leave after they work for 20 days. This Earned leave is employees right. If they dont take it, it has to be enclashed. Now how much is encashed, how much is carry forwarded, when do you want them to encash ( annualy or at exit ) is dependent on the policy you make. Sick leaves are not carry forwarded or encashed. <This message was edited>
01/09/24, 08:10 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Thank you folks. Really helpful.🙏
01/09/24, 09:35 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Hey Harika 
As per shop act Leave encashment of upto 45 is mandatory <This message was edited>
01/09/24, 09:36 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: On what stage you want to do leave encashment is upto the org
They can choose to do it end of each year or during f&f settlement when the staff is leaving
01/09/24, 09:40 - Shweta Govila HR Manager Abhi Loans: Also, encashment is done on the basis of basic of salary
01/09/24, 09:49 - Harika Velaga RR: Hey Krishna this varies per state right? How do orgs in different states handle this? I was told by a legal counsel that in case of unlimited leaves this doesn't apply.
01/09/24, 09:55 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: What labour courts / shops & establishment act of each state is that employees are getting their minimum. Maximum is as per each company policies.
01/09/24, 10:20 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Leave encampment will still be there with a capping as per shop act 
Each states shop act mentions it in the act
01/09/24, 10:21 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: This again has contesting 
As per a new ammendment it is to be done on gross and not basic but orgs still continue to choose gray are in this
01/09/24, 10:21 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: That’s right 
Like for Maharashtra and Karnataka cap of 45 is given for encashment similar for each states
01/09/24, 10:27 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Can you send the link to read on thiz amendment
01/09/24, 11:04 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Leme see if can find it
01/09/24, 11:06 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: <Media omitted>
01/09/24, 11:06 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: This is for the 45 days clause and full wages that we were discussing <This message was edited>
01/09/24, 11:13 - Tejaswi Vajinepalli Asst. Manager HRBP LEAD: This 45 days is not for an year. That's the max cap that is according to the law. In general, companies allow around 10 days of earned leaves for every year carry forward for accumulation. Max Cap is mostly limited to 40 days in many companies.
01/09/24, 11:14 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Correct 
It’s the max capping military vetoing which it will collaps
01/09/24, 11:15 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Again max capping is purely on the shop act they fall under that states the capping limit for the lifetime of the employee journey
01/09/24, 20:58 - Aman Agrawal HRT Consultant KPMG: Encashed as per basic pay. That is also by law. Basic is generally 40% of the fixed. So it isn't quite rewarding
01/09/24, 21:41 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: My 2 orgs it was given on gross
01/09/24, 21:44 - Aman Agrawal HRT Consultant KPMG: That can be a progressive choice or a negligence or a lack of awareness. Doesn't happen in Big 4 and below as of now as per my knowledge
01/09/24, 21:45 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Very rare case <This message was edited>
01/09/24, 22:03 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Out of the 5 Iv worked 
2 did gross 
2 did basic 
And 1 did nothing :) dispite law asking them to
01/09/24, 22:05 - Shweta Govila HR Manager Abhi Loans: Nice approach followed by the last one. They don't fear no one or simply don't care😂
01/09/24, 22:09 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Oh that org was one thing 
They were like him Dekh lenge :)
Bhai law ke screen shot bhej bhej thak gate hum but Vo ma hile fir hum hi nikal liye
01/09/24, 22:10 - Shweta Govila HR Manager Abhi Loans: Sahi samay pr sahi decision liya aapne

06/09/24, 22:30 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: How much should be the avg cost of payroll for a 30 to 35 cr arr org ?
06/09/24, 22:36 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: When we were making 5M$ our head count was about 70 (Engineering + manufacturing + production) our payroll cost was less than 1cr
06/09/24, 22:37 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: Today our ARR is 20M$ and head count is about 220 and monthly payroll cost is less than 3cr
06/09/24, 22:37 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: You folks are saying yearly payroll right ? <This message was edited>
06/09/24, 22:43 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I assume it is monthly
06/09/24, 22:43 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: For a 50 people team we had touched 60L/ month
06/09/24, 22:43 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Ideal range is 25-30% but it can be much higher for services organisations or labor intense, such as delivery etc..
06/09/24, 22:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Engineeringvand Sales teams constitutes the major %
06/09/24, 22:44 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: And again this all depends on what you are building, hire fast you want it out in the market etc. Accordingly, you will decide to over index
06/09/24, 22:44 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: Monthly payroll cost
06/09/24, 22:44 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Also which exact functions comprise your headcount
06/09/24, 22:46 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: So for 30-35 cr ARR, payroll can hover anywhere between 20-50% depending on the functions that comprise your headcount.
06/09/24, 23:43 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Any one from this group has US Hiring experience ?
07/09/24, 11:17 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Iv seen a range of 20 to 70 so was just taking pulse on what folks have witnessed
07/09/24, 11:18 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: And majorly saw a trend that layoff chances where high with higher payroll cost, it’s more to do with numbers than the head count in my experience basis the info I am collecting and data I have seen
09/09/24, 14:16 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Absolutely. Banks will be happy with higher payroll costs😀

09/09/24, 17:03 - Mridusha Bhaduri Sr. TA Specialist: Hi folks!

Need some suggestions!!

I want to elevate myself and pursue a certificate course in HRM from a tier 1 college. I have a total of 5 years of experience. And I come from an MBA (HR) background.
09/09/24, 18:25 - Suyash Kumar: <Media omitted>
09/09/24, 18:26 - Suyash Kumar: Thank you @⁨Ashwini Kumar Madireddy HR TBC1⁩ for sharing this
09/09/24, 18:52 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Let me share what I did, Mridusha. I was a CS grad and a dev/analytics person for 3 years before realising I am interested in HR. I did Ops, BP, Recruiting, EB for 4 years in a way I made for myself - imperfect but from the ground up. And then I realised I am going to hit a wall soon so I did a 1.5yr course from TISS - they call it SVE  program (school of vocational education: https://sve.tiss.edu/TISS/) and seems it has been rebranded now to something else. But my 2019 course was classroom in gurgaon with coursework and faculty from TISS visiting each weekend (that centre is now closed). This course was eye opening because I was studying with leaders who had handled strikes in manufacturing or handled 10k+ span in mother dairy or something similar. I learnt a lot from people and coursework here, and it helped me a lot in my program work at Unacademy in thinking and executing broadly.
09/09/24, 19:00 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Last year, I realised I need to think more strategically and know more about demonstrating value to CSuite folks, so I did a 6-month certificate course from NUS held online (https://executive-education.nus.edu.sg/programmes/global-hr-leaders-program-hrlp/) where 40 people crowd was from 12 different countries and gave me a very rich understanding of cross border issues that HR leaders need to handle for CXOs. Many of those issues I had not even envisioned. Half faculty was NUS faculty and other half were CHROs from HP, Schindler etc. I actually got more from this than my TISS course. I also paid 3x for this than my TISS 😂 but it was definitely worth it for me in the long run. Alumni network in both cases is strong.
09/09/24, 19:01 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Hope it helped
09/09/24, 19:03 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: You should not look at only tier 1 courses, but courses which will help you in the timeframe you need them to help you - short term or long term. They can come in the form of technical courses too. So just go for it! 
PS - Do the courses for learning and not a branding stamp because these courses haven’t helped me in getting interview calls, but they definitely improved me as a professional.
09/09/24, 19:23 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Wonderful. He's such a wonderful person.
09/09/24, 19:31 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Was an Iyer Subramanian one of your profs ?
09/09/24, 19:37 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: No Arvind, I think he was involved with the leadership batch (15+ yrs exp folks)
09/09/24, 19:37 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Oh ok ! My bad
09/09/24, 19:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: my batch exp was 5-12yrs. no problem, I would have loved to learn from him too. Which subject does he cover?
09/09/24, 19:38 - Arvindh Murthy HR: I know that he teaches there but not sure which experience levels
09/09/24, 19:39 - Arvindh Murthy HR: He is an IR guy !! Was with Asian Paints ! Does labour law and all that

10/09/24, 16:07 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hey All
Can you guys share the referral policy that you are following in your company?

Also, do you give a referral bonus in case an employee has referred someone from LinkedIn and doesn't know them from outside? If not, how do you track the same?
10/09/24, 17:35 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: Does anyone has any insights on S P Jain's Global MBA program? Someone I know wants to pursue.
10/09/24, 18:30 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Shared with you in DM

Secondly, I would pay the employee even if he has sourced it from LinkedIn. Objective of an employee referral to me is, encourage employees to refer and earn. At the same time, a helping hand to the recruiter
10/09/24, 18:35 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: I agree with that.

For BDRs and Sales AEs based in India and focused on global customers, do you have any data on:
 
1. Compensation / pay structure for Sales AEs in India focused on global market?  { 15 to 25 lakhs)
2. Do India companies typically use a 60:40 or 70:30 or 80:20 plan? - Yes , few will use 90:10 model 
3. What ratio of On Target Earning (Base + Target Incentive Comp) to Quota do these roles typically carry? i.e. if their base + on target incentive is $25,000 per year, should we set a closed deal value of $250,000 (1:10 ratio) or $500,000 (1:20 ratio)? - Depends purely based on management call .

17/09/24, 19:35 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Hello folks,

Quick question- 

Case : An employee joins a company on a x date and resigns after a week. 

Now is it termination of employment mail which has to be sent or an offer revoking email?
17/09/24, 19:37 - Sindhu J Thaakur HR Consultant: Offer cannot be revoked once the person has joined the company
17/09/24, 19:38 - Sindhu J Thaakur HR Consultant: Also he has resigned formally (I hope) hence termination of employment is also not advisable
17/09/24, 19:39 - Sindhu J Thaakur HR Consultant: U need to accept the resignation, clear dues if any and give him employment letter
17/09/24, 19:40 - Lakshmy K HR TBC1: Has the appointment letter been issued?
17/09/24, 19:41 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Understood. What happens in a case where there’s no formal notification has been made by the employee’s end he has just dropped a text and not responding anymore?
17/09/24, 19:41 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Yes
17/09/24, 19:42 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: @⁨Sindhu J Thaakur HR Consultant⁩

17/09/24, 19:47 - Mehvish K HR Head Travelwings: This happens a lot when you hire for sales. 
If you still want to be super safe, drop them an official email saying you have absconded from work and are unresponsive and the company is not liable to pay any dues. This way you protect yourself against any legal mess.
17/09/24, 19:50 - Swapna Kole: <Media omitted>
17/09/24, 19:51 - Sindhu J Thaakur HR Consultant: Send him an email and ask him to resign formally. Also mention that he will be marked absconding and company will not be liable to  pay any dues or provide any employment letter
17/09/24, 19:58 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Got it. Thanks you folks💙Great help🙌🏼
17/09/24, 19:59 - Akshatha B Raj HR ObjectWin Technology: Does this applies to folks who have served for brief?
Let’s say for eg: 2 days or within a week

18/09/24, 06:10 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Good morning Folks,
There are some software tools that help streamline access to all tools like  Slack, Notion etc through a single window. Does anyone use any  IAM (Identity Access Management) tools ? Please recommend based on your experience. Regards
18/09/24, 06:29 - Nimesh Mathur Haptik HR: Okta, OneLogin, Zluri.
18/09/24, 06:35 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: If you use Microsoft cloud for your mail and teams, MS bundles Azure active directory (not Entra) cloud for you. Otherwise Okta is very seamless for Gsuite (haven’t seen it used with MS). Do implement GDPR and SOX via IAM (and HIPAA if you’re serving healthcare clients in US), becomes easier for audit later.

19/09/24, 11:01 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: all design platforms like dribble, behance have people posting their motion graphics too. so you'll need to dive in to portfolios
19/09/24, 11:04 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: hire from media outlets who use a lot of motion graphics to grab eyeballs (all those aajtak whoosh effects and breaking news) if you're B2C (and need flashy). if you're B2B/SaaS then go for people with more understated animations on storytelling. usually shown in webinar marketing pieces or storytelling pieces. <This message was edited>
19/09/24, 11:05 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: good folks can do both regardless. most will have most of their experiment portfolios over Gdrive. all this helped me when I did this hiring 2 years back.

24/09/24, 00:40 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Completely agree, but I think that session from such design leaders can be a good orientation into that thought process, which is what Bhagya checked for - a workshop

30/09/24, 20:21 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Sharpen one's own design sense first:
1. Train yourself atleast 2-3 times with https://cantunsee.space/
2. Do 2-3 live sourcing with your designer HM for 30 mins each, once a week. note what doesn't work for him/her.
3. Resumes matter less for designers, portfolios are king. But a poorly designed resume should be a reject (too many colours, strange fonts, incorrect typefacing, etc)
If the portfolio already has examples of the assignment you want to give them, skip it. If they worked in a company before which solved the problem the assignment covers, skip it. Go directly to scheduling them with HM and then subsequent rounds (be especially attentive in rounds with product managers)
30/09/24, 20:23 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: ask to shadow 1-2 rounds with each stakeholder (but mostly final round person won't be comfortable with this). but most design folks will be happy to include you that you want to be so involved and understand their craft <This message was edited>

I just wanted to understand that while doing reference checks in India for a very Senior Role, do we initiate an email, call the references, or a mixture of both if needed?
05/10/24, 08:48 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: An email is the best way, if there is no response, then a call is warranted
05/10/24, 08:56 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Wanted to understand, why are calls not the preferred mode? Since, it can give us a better understanding.
05/10/24, 08:57 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: This is a for a very senior role and referrees will also be senior, they wouldn't appreciate a cold call. A connect from the candidate will help, else an email followed by a call is the right approach <This message was edited>
05/10/24, 09:00 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Hm, thought the same. Thanks alot for the help.
05/10/24, 09:01 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Yes, send a mail asking for a time to speak or informing them you’ll call at so-and-so time and do the check on call. They’re not going to write to you, they’re ultra busy people. Do the call post 8/9 pm for very senior folks, that’s when they’re actually free
05/10/24, 09:03 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Noted. I think a call might be a bit weird considering we are hiring a director and the references will also be somewhat at the same position.
05/10/24, 09:03 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Not sure, if HR's out their do call.
05/10/24, 09:04 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Is this a reference that was provided by the candidate or is this a blind ref check. 

For blind - you should get someone you know to introduce you to the reference. 

For non-blind reference;
Send an email to the reference to seek a date & time that works for a call while also seeking confirmation that they are ok with a call.
05/10/24, 09:04 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Non-blind reference.
05/10/24, 09:05 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: So its a peer reference. That's fine as long as you are aligning on the context of what you seek from that reference..
05/10/24, 09:07 - Kulika Dua Asst Manager HR WeCredit: Understood. Thanks!

09/10/24, 15:22 - Karan Sharma TA Lead Unicommerce: Ideally
09/10/24, 15:23 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Is it safe to put 1st Oct? is there a way we can put 1st oct also?
09/10/24, 15:24 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: If person was let go on 1st oct, mark other payouts as joining bonus or some kind of non-standard payout and keep 1st oct as last day for audit

09/10/24, 15:25 - Asha S K Sr. HR Administrator Unient: You can mention 1st Oct and mark the payment as financial assistance or bonus. <This message was edited>

09/10/24, 15:26 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: thanks guys
09/10/24, 15:27 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: can also mark 2 months pay under salary advance and ask the person to pay it back otherwise BGV will get impacted, if you really care for that money
09/10/24, 15:27 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: but it's not really enforceable by law
09/10/24, 15:28 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: just curious - if he gets a job from 15th Oct, would it not be a conflict situation for the other employer
09/10/24, 15:31 - +91 99023 29420: It certainly is! So marking it as a non standard payout during FnF might be  ideal
09/10/24, 15:31 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Ok
09/10/24, 15:32 - +91 99023 29420: If not will lead to complexity during audits

17/10/24, 07:53 - Dhriti Mahajan Talent kipi.bi: Cz Zepto is targeting Blinkit n Zomato employees....that's what I've heard from ppl 🙂‍↕
17/10/24, 07:58 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I wonder how long that they had 0 notice and why only they are facing the heat now!
17/10/24, 07:59 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I almost went into depression to know that they have such a super matured people independent model 😎
17/10/24, 08:01 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah it was there on LinkedIn 
I don’t think moving to 0 notice period model will benefit any employer considering India ecosystem of hiring
17/10/24, 08:01 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Both sides : employee and employer
17/10/24, 08:02 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Transition period is human
17/10/24, 08:02 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: It’s become increasingly difficult to have people join organisations 
Imagine to deal with 0 notice period
17/10/24, 08:02 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Probably when robots start becoming our workforce, these are possible
17/10/24, 08:02 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Hahaha
17/10/24, 08:03 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I think it may still work in favour of recruiters , reduced notice period will only help people not having time to shop for offers
17/10/24, 08:04 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I like the companies who have matured in their model of internal mobility and l&d <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:04 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Zomato claimed 2 things in public media:
- they dont talk to people / chade talent who are active in the market but they chase the talent they want. 
- Then they let go people instantly like instant delivery !
Damn this is dream model for any company like nirvana 🙏
17/10/24, 08:05 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Reduced notice period in one company is no guarentee to improve joining ratios of another company.
17/10/24, 08:05 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I heard that and he got trolled for this 😊
17/10/24, 08:06 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Ofcourse but still one step towards candidates to have lesser time to offer shop
17/10/24, 08:06 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: People fear hiring folks with 60/ 90 days now
17/10/24, 08:06 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Offer shop happens even in probation period
17/10/24, 08:06 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I have my stakeholder refusing to take them
17/10/24, 08:07 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Hmm i have different take on this ! Lets discuss offline👍
17/10/24, 08:08 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I know what you are saying Kumuda , folks change irrespective. It just human mindset to play safe
17/10/24, 08:08 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yup will connect
17/10/24, 08:08 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: 180 day notice period hona chahiye ideally to. only then we will have true modern freedom
17/10/24, 08:08 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Yeah, it works fine in high trust environment of US and Europe. Candidates share transparently about other offers and ongoing processes, many times sharing companies too. Because each industry follows one model largely. India’s low trust environment can’t do this where skill varies too greatly and historically have been taken advantage of regularly from early stages
17/10/24, 08:09 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Hahaha seriously ?
17/10/24, 08:09 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I wrote for this ^
17/10/24, 08:10 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yup I agree . US and Uk it’s so easy to hire
17/10/24, 08:10 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: arre just kidding
17/10/24, 08:10 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Slavery 🤣🤣
17/10/24, 08:10 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I think another solution - counter offer dena hi band kardo
17/10/24, 08:10 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Life sorted
17/10/24, 08:10 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: But thn candidates have their own stories to it
17/10/24, 08:12 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Is trust the only game changer?
17/10/24, 08:15 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: Totally agree...am a strong supporter to bring down notice period which is on par with global markets to 15 days max, by this way shopping for offers would come down drastically...this approach may not be accepted by service orginasations as it would impact their bench strength...in general we need to change this notice period on the whole...good that atleast some have started... <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:16 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Candidates in India will still shop around! 🙃
17/10/24, 08:17 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We have cutshorts and instahyre😀
17/10/24, 08:17 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: However not to the extent of 5 - 6 offers...may be 1 additional offer max...
17/10/24, 08:18 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Multiple offers and multiple opportunities are there only between 2 to 8 years as everyone is fishing talent here
17/10/24, 08:19 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If we change thiz approach a lot will change
17/10/24, 08:20 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: <Media omitted>
17/10/24, 08:23 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: A good read 
The typical notice period for tech jobs varies significantly between the US and Europe. In the US, it's common for employees to provide 2-3 weeks of notice, sometimes up to 4 weeks, as a courtesy. This period isn't typically mandated by law, and employees can technically leave their job at any time ¹.

In contrast, European employment contracts often require a much longer notice period, typically 3 months or more. This extended period is designed to provide employers with sufficient time to find a replacement and ensure a smoother transition. However, it can also limit labor mobility and impact wages ¹.

It's worth noting that notice periods can vary across European countries. For example, Germany has longer notice periods, while Greece has shorter periods, sometimes as short as 2 weeks ¹. France also has a relatively standard notice period of 30 days, with employees required to pay the employer for each missing day if they fail to provide adequate notice ¹.

*Notice Periods in European Countries:*

- _Germany_: Longer notice periods
- _Greece_: Shorter notice periods (as short as 2 weeks)
- _France_: 30 days

Overall, understanding the typical notice periods in the US and Europe can help you navigate the job market and plan your next career move.
17/10/24, 08:23 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: Leadership and mid manager levels are no less...have seen them coming with atleast 2 offers in Hand and negotiating for better offers... 🙃 <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:25 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: When candidates say they have multiple offers? How do you verify? Just curious <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:26 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Very rare. How many opportunities really are there here vs number of people. Supply/demand ratios !
17/10/24, 08:28 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: They openly show those offers, some would hide the Employer name but some are fine to share...
17/10/24, 08:29 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: So u ask them to share offer letters ?
17/10/24, 08:29 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Of course, after our interview process is done
17/10/24, 08:30 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Ok
17/10/24, 08:32 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: A consultant suggested me to speed up hiring process by counter offering . So the deal was,  he will source people with multiple offers and we should offer them with just 1 discussion. However we did not go ahead with this approach. <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Company has good revenues / funding , one can spend in many ways 🙄
17/10/24, 08:34 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: When we have conversation around comp, most of the candidates quote that they have additional offers from so n so company and they volunteer to share...post which recruiters need a proof to seek internal approvals to offer better comp or be on par...which makes it more competitive n leads to bad practice...especially in services environment TAT's matter a lot due to Billing pressure...
17/10/24, 08:35 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: This is an approach that I have leveraged in a competetive space for immediate hiring while ensuring skill too. A person with multiple offers is more likely to be prepped to clear interviews (not necessarily more skillful). You go higher than median but within budget.
17/10/24, 08:35 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yes! So how do we build talent pipeline is the real problem to solve. Answer is not always hiring from market
17/10/24, 08:35 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: All interview processes index for prep and not skill, especially tech
17/10/24, 08:36 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: What was your offer to joining ratio in this model? Why people still preferred you even when they had multiple offers?  Its only M factor or something else?
17/10/24, 08:37 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Lets have detailed discussion thos Saturday after breakfast club talk 👍 <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:37 - Adrija Datta TA Specialist Rupicard joined using your invite
17/10/24, 08:38 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: *detailed
17/10/24, 08:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: M factor of course, but Interview experience impacted the decision the most. They’ve already experienced speaking with 1-3 companies, now who respects them the most in process, who’s the fastest, how transparent in setting expectations (both money and role wise) and how aligned is the interview.
17/10/24, 08:39 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I did specific collective interviews/drive for such people <This message was edited>
17/10/24, 08:39 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: There are internal limitations where resources cannot be cross utilised due to client policy (referring to services environment), there would be no space for having bench resources n other limitations...however product companies have scope to have such best practices which I have cherished...
17/10/24, 08:41 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: There were still many drops when a person continues to index on money, which is fine (as they should). But TATs were cut in both joining and onboarding readiness.
17/10/24, 08:42 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: When your company is suffering, there’s no war a recruiter won’t wage to win
17/10/24, 08:43 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: Rightly said...in spite of all these limitations having a 86% + joining ratio shows the best practices followed (building candidate experience, internal improvements, etc etc)
17/10/24, 08:52 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I asked this because in my case mostly our process and interview exp did win when the comp waz not much different. I have lost to M factor even after the great role alignment, interiew process and growth prospects. So in case of multiple offer candidates we thoroughly check on these factors so that both sides time and energy is saved.
17/10/24, 08:58 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Shopping around the offers mostly we face it with active job seekers compared to passive ones is what I observed in my recruiting experience 

Coz the passive seekers will seek to gather more information during the screening call and let us know at first if they don't want to continue further wherein for active the first priority is on who pays highest and better benefits and infrastructure rather than focusing on career path and as we know mostly these are the ones who again switches the jobs in less than a year
17/10/24, 09:05 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: But then we have to be very careful while probing to active seekers, why are they looking out for change (is it role change? Financial?  Circumstances? Etc.,) this way we can have better understanding on the candidates. I have seen many juniors who just explain role, and schedule the interview call rather than understanding of the candidates (the call duration max ends in 5 mins) later coming back n saying candidates has dropped and he got better opportunity why not ours companies is best option to him? 

Understanding the role and candidates, plays a major role here to build a good relationship which helps to bring the best and aligning the right fit in job role
17/10/24, 09:11 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: This is where hand picking right recruiters becomes all the more critical, n continuous monitoring and coaching would create the right impact...
17/10/24, 09:14 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Well the core team that i hired has atleast 5 yrs tenure
17/10/24, 09:21 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: Don't take me wrong, it is all about the quality of recruiter n not just number of years of experience, I had faced pit falls thinking  higher the experience levels the quality of recruiter is better, no, only comp increased n quality came down...
17/10/24, 09:23 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Exactly, I had a experience recently with one of the recruiters who is hiring for Lloyds..

Unfortunately I couldn't carry my cv hard copy as I was attending interview in other 2 companies and went directly to this but then before four days shared my updated Cv with her. When they asked I requested for the print out they had escalated saying the first impression is best one, we would understand it for technical people and helps them with printout but you being into recruitment why you didn't carry yours...and you failed in it by not carrying your resume for the interviews. 


In my mind what is meant by first impression?  Why only helping to tech folks and not to non tech? The interview scheduled at 2 pm and recruiter came to collect at 3:30 pm for the resume did the company not failed?  Recruiter not failed here? 

The answer from the recruiter side we are busy with lots of work n meetings.  Then why did you even schedule the interview call should have done your work... 

I understand everyone is busy and ad-hoc will be but why are justifying at one and not the other side mainly here the understanding failed
17/10/24, 09:26 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Absolutely, it's all about quality of the recruiters nothing on experience front..
17/10/24, 09:28 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: +1, I agree with this. unfortunately, this is a big gap.

24/10/24, 15:19 - Jeevitha Mohan Sr. Exec HR Mirrar: Hi Everyone, Just wanted to understand what will be the basic hike percentage for a startup ?
24/10/24, 15:24 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Hike is generally provided basis of companies performance + individual performance .
24/10/24, 15:25 - Suyash Kumar: I would assume that this is already clear. Can you provide percentages Sampath? <This message was edited>
24/10/24, 15:26 - Suyash Kumar: As that's the question here
24/10/24, 15:30 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: mention role + exp/level, you'll get answers. the ask is too generic for the answers to be helpful to you
24/10/24, 15:31 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: In startups especially if its Bootstrapped, cashflow visibility is the first factor, and then the critical competencies, Niche skills that needs to be retained comes up. U can then see the market data, can u match, cant match, if u cant match , think of ways to innovate ur comp structure etc etc
24/10/24, 15:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If you have PMS system sets
 in, it gives you the data on performance👍 <This message was edited>
24/10/24, 15:34 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: Adaptive compensation strategies are crucial for retaining niche skills
24/10/24, 15:34 - Jeevitha Mohan Sr. Exec HR Mirrar: It's kind of mixed , there are tech people, sales , Hr and the salary range differs for everyone. Few are on lesser package side and few on higher range.

We thought of giving it on bases of their rating percentage for instance if we rated someone 4 so their percentage will be 10 but here is the problem, people with High package and receiving 10% makes sense but people on a lower side 10% will be very less to them. 
So wanted to understand how to go about this ?
24/10/24, 15:35 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: it is an allignment between how u want to compete with your indusrty competitor in your sector. and the talent and ability brought by the employee…. so if the person is skilled and might negotiate outside then u should look for offering hike accordinngly to retain. Also there are other retention strategies including esops and company culture matters
24/10/24, 15:37 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: u should devise the performance scorecard taking all parameters both subjective and objective, it is a detailed exercise which has to be done and make sure everyone understands. though u will still have someone challenging but it is continous improvement exercise
24/10/24, 15:41 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: In this case what you can do is have a benchmarking for the role of the employees and make a correction and top it give the percentage 

This way you are making sure employees are rightly paid
24/10/24, 15:42 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: As per my knowledge here is the data points :: 
1. Early-stage startups (0-5 years): 10-20% annual hike
2. Growth-stage startups (5-10 years): 15-25% annual hike
3. Established startups (10+ years): 20-30% annual hike

——— OR 

Avg performer - 4 to 6%
Good performer - 10 to 15%
Outstanding performer - 25 to 30% 

I am not sure for specific to technology / industry .
24/10/24, 15:48 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Also it depends on what budget we hired initially , budgets for this role, if the person grew beyond the role, etc etc finally.....
24/10/24, 15:49 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: There is no direct formula that works for startups. Given the current market scenario, it might be also for certain roles
24/10/24, 17:15 - Manjunath Sreekanta Murthy VP Payroll Deutsche Bank requested to join.
24/10/24, 19:19 - Yaswanth Goteti Head Of People Fincent: Any connections in target and coupang? my friend is holding offers and need to know more about company, culture etc. Lmk, good karma points wil be credited 🙂
24/10/24, 19:58 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Coupang is a solid bet, target is slow moving but more balanced. Coupang is still growing, ESOPs are growing at solid pace + they just entered India so lots of upside in a growing setup (culture, involvement etc) Holding Offer in which function? If ops, then Coupang > target. I don’t know much about Coupang tech team here.
24/10/24, 20:01 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: To add Coupang is a Korean company, so you can expect how the work culture will be. 

Target is already having a smooth engine running in India. 

Now it's all based in comp, stocks vesting, team, and growth trajectory of the individual
24/10/24, 20:01 - Madhusudhan K Sr. TA Consultant Careernet: I would like to add here, coupang is providing RSUs not esops. it's a listed company.
24/10/24, 20:04 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Yess, my bad. I meant RSUs. They are valued highly for them.

25/10/24, 11:53 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Hello everyone, can anyone help me with a contact list of tier 1 college placement cells? 

We are hiring for multiple interns for both tech and non tech roles, starting from Jan (6 months duration)
25/10/24, 12:00 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Most tier 1 colleges don’t have 6 months internships it’s 2 months for them
25/10/24, 12:09 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: No, there are  discussions going on as many start up are preferring campuses which provides a minimum of 6 months internships
25/10/24, 12:20 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: IIT Gn and IIT hyd so far have not agreeded on it 
So not sure how this goes
25/10/24, 13:39 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: they are doing remote internship for long term too
25/10/24, 13:39 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: but this may not be through their placement cell
25/10/24, 13:41 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: IIT Hyd and IIT Mandi allows their pre-final year students for a 6 month internship, not the final year students. 

NIT Bhopal, Raipur, Silchar are some NITs that allow their final year students for 6 months internships.
25/10/24, 13:55 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: yeah NIT Surat, Surathkal, Warnagal also allow 6 months internship
25/10/24, 13:56 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: But with the Surathkal, Warangal, Trichy campuses they'd prefer if you give an internship + FTE offer and not just an internship offer.
25/10/24, 14:37 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: most of the new IITs and NITs allow 6-month internships, but these are not tier 1
25/10/24, 14:37 - Suyash Kumar: I see
25/10/24, 14:38 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Agreed. The older IITs don't have 6 months internship provision.
25/10/24, 14:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: IIIT Hyderabad is considered a better bet than IIT Hyderabad
25/10/24, 14:40 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: IIIT Allahabad and Hyderabad are often slept-on gems. Their curriculum is most aligned with industry work. Plus because the colleges are not as popular as IITs/NITs, students adopt hustler attitude without entitlement. knowledge + hard work.
25/10/24, 14:41 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: My exp in quality from these two has been on par with BITS Pilani.
25/10/24, 14:42 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Only hiccup with BITS Pilani is that as part of PS-1/2, they've told that companies like Apple, Microsoft, etc. get to interview students and pick interns. Other orgs are just allocated basis the requirement shared. 

Not sure if the others have had similar exp. This is at least if gone through the Placement Cell route,
25/10/24, 14:45 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yes, worked with them. Instead of just the double and triple Ts , good to look at the portals where students have uploaded their code bases, projects, assignments. We get more wider choice of gems
25/10/24, 14:48 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: Yeah that’s the worst part of it 

I tried too but they don’t allow to interview
25/10/24, 14:48 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If you go through college rules, starts ups dont get to meet the talent even if students are interested.
25/10/24, 14:48 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Go through other sources. Now a days , students are also searching offcampus.
25/10/24, 14:49 - Suyash Kumar: VIT? Manipal?
25/10/24, 14:51 - Vikas Sawant Sr. TA CommerceIQ: We have hired on 6months internship from NSIT ,NIT jameshedpur
25/10/24, 14:55 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yes. VIT people are very much available in Blore and Manipal has a campus in Blore too.
25/10/24, 15:00 - Suyash Kumar: For quality candidates, for Manipal, I would recommend the Manipal campus
25/10/24, 15:01 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Hmm i would disagree

12/11/24, 12:47 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Good afternoon folks,
Looking for your advise,
We are in Bengaluru and as per S&E Act in Karnataka,  we are to allow max 45 days of leave encashment during FNF. 
We plan to have encashment every year (max 5 days) instead of allowing it to accumulate till FNF. 
Could you please share what you have been doing so that we are aligned with the norm here.
Regards
12/11/24, 12:50 - Nilesh Godle HR Consultant Thence: We don't allow leaves to carry forward beyond 30 each year, so they have to encash excess leaves by 31st dec or consume it
12/11/24, 12:52 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Thank you 🙏
12/11/24, 13:03 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: We had an angle of mandatory leave to be taken each year to reduce encashment load
12/11/24, 13:04 - Sunit Desai Sr. Manager People Experience CashFlo: At our organisation, we don't encash leaves, but we allow folks to carry forward leaves to next year, but to encourage them to take leaves, the maximum carry forward at any given point is just 45 days, anything beyond that get's lapsed
12/11/24, 13:09 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: But this will then put load during exits 
If the churn ratio is low then this works but if it’s a startup then avg churn ratio won’t be low then 15 % <This message was edited>
12/11/24, 13:13 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: To reduce cash outflow during FNF, we plan to have encashment every year end (max 5 days) with a ceiling of total 45 days per employees lifetime in the company.

Quick question. 
Is there any ideal scale for HRBP per x number of employees?
Please share your knowledge.
14/11/24, 10:40 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hi All
I have a question.

Are freelancers eligible for any company holiday (mandated national holiday or festival holiday), or are they supposed to work during it?
14/11/24, 10:41 - Aakash Singh Sr. Manager TA Efficiently: Freelancers must be getting paid with correspondence to their hours or a result, correct?
14/11/24, 10:42 - Aman Agrawal HRT Consultant KPMG: Freelancers are paid per day basis in Jobs.
14/11/24, 10:42 - Aakash Singh Sr. Manager TA Efficiently: If so, there holdiay’s should not be your concern. If they complete the work in stipulated time, they get paid or not, same goes for number of hours or day, they days they work, they get paid, if they don’t, they don’t get paid
14/11/24, 10:52 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: It depends how the contracting is done..usually hours but can go monthly or outcome based
14/11/24, 10:55 - Aakash Singh Sr. Manager TA Efficiently: Even if it is monthly, it should have certain stipulation and benchmarkings done to measure the activities, you just compare the metrics w.r.t the benchmarkings and you pay on monthly basis, freelancers do not work for us directly thus their leaves should not be our concern, the delivery of whatever they are supposed to do is what should effect their pay
14/11/24, 11:14 - Suyash Kumar: Folks, any insights on this?
14/11/24, 11:17 - Aakash Singh Sr. Manager TA Efficiently left
14/11/24, 11:18 - Nilesh Godle HR Consultant Thence: effective range is upto 200 employees but depend on the division they are part of like it might be different for HRBP for sales vs HRBP for tech <This message was edited>
14/11/24, 11:20 - Faisal Uttanwala Asst Manager HRBP Glenmark Pharma: Mid to large size Start-up would be somewhere around 200-300 HC

20/11/24, 09:25 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: While we are on offer letters (and slightly off topic), regular reminder not to put non-compete clauses as scare tactics in your offer letters because non-compete is inadmissable in Indian court if the employee joins your competitor and challenges the contract terms in court. You will lose.

One doubt, while curating the holiday list for Karnataka, do we consider the list of general holidays or restricted holidays, or both?

adding the link I am referring to - https://www.udayavani.com/english-news/karnataka-govt-announces-holiday-calendar-for-2025
22/11/24, 17:07 - Suyash Kumar: @⁨Shivani Goyal TA Associate⁩ this is the official one
22/11/24, 17:07 - Suyash Kumar: Or this for restricted holidays

22/11/24, 17:15 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Okk, got it
22/11/24, 17:21 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: I believe it's because Ugadi is considered the New Year. As a result, January 1st is treated as a restricted holiday, and for government offices and for Bank in Karnataka, it is business as usual (BAU)
22/11/24, 17:26 - Me: <Media omitted>

23/11/24, 10:05 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Good morning Folks, 
As a 10 years old B2B SaaS start up with about 250 people, we have migrated from unlimited leave to a capped leave system. We want to align with other orgs in similar phase, size or age in crafting our leave policy.

I am compiling a Google sheet for data points on leaves by various orgs.

Could you please share data for the orgs you have worked or you are aware of in the following manner:
1. Name of org:
2. Size (No. Of employees):
3. Age(Years since raising)
4. Types and Number of days of leave offered.
5. Leave encashment allowed (Y/N) and how many days:

Thank you all 🙌🙏🫡
23/11/24, 11:13 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Few things you may want to consider while designing leaves are:
- Do you want it to be shops and establishment act compliant? If you have offices in different states then design it according to that state.
- Look at funding/cash flow situation of your company which actually decides paid leaves apart from what has to be given minimum. Will this cost be ok for company even it scales to more employees? 
- Avg age groups of the employees as the needs might differ
- Should be simple and easy on admin mgmt
- Last but not the least employees should feel it a useful one <This message was edited>
23/11/24, 11:16 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Thank you Kumuda.
Till now we were not compliant with  S and E Act.  But I feel, as we scale and grow in size, it is safer to be compliant. 
Average age is 23-25 yrs. <This message was edited>
23/11/24, 11:16 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yes 👍
23/11/24, 11:17 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto:

01/12/24, 16:18 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: When Bangalore has many hangout places why to visit only MG road
01/12/24, 16:20 - Suyash Kumar: Accessibility for people without vehicles

3. Central to all parts of Bangalore

We already did. Unfortunately not many options for food and MTR made us wait for 30 mins+ for a table
01/12/24, 16:34 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: Food options are lesser in the periphery
01/12/24, 16:34 - Shrutkirti Nailwal HR: How about Koramangala ?? Amudham is so good
01/12/24, 16:34 - Suyash Kumar: Not enough space to accommodate the number of people that we get

01/12/24, 16:48 - Suyash Kumar: Too far for most people other than those living around. Not central
01/12/24, 16:49 - Suyash Kumar: Can try if others are open to it. Still not central enough is my opinion but if others are ok with it, sure
01/12/24, 16:54 - Suyash Kumar: Let's try to explore alternative venues for TBC for Jan edition as the timeline is a bit tight
01/12/24, 16:55 - Suyash Kumar: For Dec 21 meetup, requesting the community to please suggest places where 8-10 people can meet, is central and accessible by public transport

01/12/24, 17:02 - Suyash Kumar: Can you please help me with some specific places as I'm not very familiar with Jayanagar parks and eateries?

05/12/24, 14:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Hmm not necessarily. A good assessment test/platform is able to find the top talent irrespective of tire 1 or 2 or 3.

06/12/24, 12:50 - Sanaah Jain HR Executive Rigi: Hi everyone,
I’m currently looking to hire an Associate DevOps Engineer with 1-2 years of experience. The ideal candidate would have worked in product-based companies, preferably startups, and possess strong experience in AWS Cloud and Kubernetes.

I’ve been actively sourcing through LinkedIn as the inbound quality hasn’t been great, but I’m struggling to build a strong funnel. To add to the challenge, I have a 30-day notice period constraint and am specifically looking for candidates with the mentioned skill set.

If you have any referrals, leads, or suggestions on how to effectively build a funnel, I’d greatly appreciate it.
Thank you!
06/12/24, 12:52 - Drushya Shetty Founding Member TheSocials: What’s the budget? @⁨Sanaah Jain HR Executive Rigi⁩

06/12/24, 13:56 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Chances of you finding a devops guy from product companies might be very less.. having worked and being involved in team structuring, it is advantageous for these companied to have devops firms deputing their engineers full time.
06/12/24, 13:58 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Your chances of finding the right is high in core devops services companies who are working with product companies.
06/12/24, 14:07 - Sanaah Jain HR Executive Rigi: Any recommendations on what companies can I target?
06/12/24, 14:16 - Suma Gururaj Sr. Manager TA LendingKart: Relevance labs could be a best bet for you.

12/12/24, 09:24 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Sense is fine Swapna
12/12/24, 09:25 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: It’s not as costly as other ATS and covers fundamentals
12/12/24, 09:25 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: We just started with Zoho implementation
12/12/24, 09:26 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: Over all experiences is good till now
12/12/24, 09:26 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: Sense is comparatively costlier I believe
12/12/24, 09:26 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: Zoho will give good deal
12/12/24, 09:26 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Don’t know Zoho cost
12/12/24, 09:26 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: Provided it meets your ATS cost
12/12/24, 09:27 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: We moved away from sense to Zoho
12/12/24, 09:27 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: But as compared to greenhouse , lever - sense is cheaper
12/12/24, 09:27 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: Greenhouse lever are on the higher side for sure
12/12/24, 09:27 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Why Praful ? Was it only cost decision or you feel in someway Zoho is better
12/12/24, 09:30 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: I felt Zoho is better and interms of cost I got better deal
12/12/24, 09:30 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: 30-40 less then how much we were paying to sense
12/12/24, 09:30 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Cool
12/12/24, 09:30 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: If I am paying 10 L for sense I will get almost same in Zoho for 6-6.5 L
12/12/24, 09:31 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: But yes one need to negotiate harder sometimes
12/12/24, 09:31 - Swapna Kole: Thanks Neha and Praful for sharing your thoughts. So Praful, was cost only the differentiator or was there any other reason to move from Sense to Zoho
12/12/24, 09:32 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: Cost was number 1 for sure but it also has all the features that sense has
12/12/24, 09:32 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: And UI is also good
12/12/24, 09:32 - Praful Kulkarni Sr. Manager TA Licious: And offcourse the other usual ATs features

12/12/24, 12:44 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: anything else ? <This message was edited>
12/12/24, 12:44 - Sunit Desai Sr. Manager People Experience CashFlo: Normally I try doing proactive pipeline building in two scenarios:
1). *When the recruitment is little slow*, then I take up mapping projects, by figuring out which departments might need talent in future, or which departments regularly need talent after specific intervals. By doing this, it will save your time in search, when an actual requirement comes up, you will just to connect with the talent pool.
2). *When I make an offer to a candidate*, I have a devised a scoring system which has multiple factors in it personal & professional, which help me determine a percentage score of the candidate’s joining probabilty. Based on the joining percentage I get an idea if I need to actively keep on searching for backups on not. If the joining percentage seems low, then I proactively keep on building a backup pipeline, by doing 1st round of interviews with backups and keeping them warm.
12/12/24, 12:46 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: sure thanks Sunit - great idea

13/12/24, 14:05 - Salonee Bhatia Lead TA Tanla: Hi All,

I'd like to hear your thoughts on offering leave during probation.

Currently, we don't have any defined leave policy for probation periods. Employees can take leave in case of an emergency, but it would be considered as Leave Without Pay (LOP).

Before considering any revisions to the policy, I wanted to understand how other companies are handling this.
13/12/24, 14:09 - Varun Kapadia Asst Manager Checkmate: Our company offers 2 consecutive days of leaves during probation. These are paid leaves.
13/12/24, 14:14 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: 1 paid leave during probation period . After completion of probation it’s 1.25 paid leave added by month on month .
13/12/24, 14:17 - Ipshita Ray HR Ops Specialist Tricog: We have 3 months probation, we offer them 1 leave per month for the 3 months. If they finish their 3 leaves then the leaves taken after that will be LOP. 

Once confirmed they have earned leaves that is 1.5 leaves every 20th of the month for 12 months. This way they utilize their leaves plus ofcourse we have the casual and sick leave

16/12/24, 20:50 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Yehi Shivani my recommendation is to ask the founder and the CEO to send a special note to him along with his colleagues, create a slam book along with that, give him a bouquet, a small gift along with a cake celebrations .

23/12/24, 19:26 - Suyash Kumar: Welcome to RR Jayant
23/12/24, 19:28 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: What if it fails? So its better to do during offer stage or earlier to it. Some companies do basic bgv like identify before the interviews start. So it differs from org to org
23/12/24, 19:36 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: There is a clause to terminate employment if an employee fails their BGV. People's have even been let go years later. Once something comes to light that is untrue, an employer still has the right to terminate employment..
23/12/24, 19:38 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Many service companies who have BFSI clients may undertake a BGV before they can allocate an employee to a clients server, as per a mandate from that client. Examples are - Citi, JPMC, UBS etc..
23/12/24, 19:39 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: Thanks Suyash
23/12/24, 19:41 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I know but we can avoid this is my pov
23/12/24, 19:43 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yeah but there have been times that rhe BGV doesn't complete within even 30 days. Imagine the employee who has resigned & now is not in a position to get onboarded due to such stipulations
23/12/24, 20:14 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Hmm..now a days identity verification like pan/aadhar takes few min, address verification physical too takes about a week until and unless its very remote, education verification inside india is 3 to 5 days, yes abroad universities takes more time, criminal record verification max 1 week. Only the ex employment takes time amd yes this part we can only initiate after the person joins. So we can plan it better imstead of putting everything after joining....
23/12/24, 20:17 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: Spring verify claim that they can complete core BGV in just less than a minute...not sure if any of u have availed their services...
23/12/24, 20:18 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: 4.3/5 rating...which is highest in the industry
23/12/24, 20:20 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I have used ongrid so know the timelines well
23/12/24, 20:22 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Mostly agree except on education. Depending on which university or school someone has passed out of. Many are not yet digitalized. But things have overall become easier.. However SLAs are mostly breached. As Head HR, BGV was also under my purview. Anyway I just went back and realized that the query was regarding all the components other orgs consider in their BGV. 

@⁨GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto⁩ - my time is was
Criminal - national and international
Highest education
Last 5 year employment verification upto a maximum of 2 employers. 

Given folks moving around all the time, we made address verification redundant. For our orgs, it didn't seem to matter much.
23/12/24, 20:24 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: I think this also has to do with their blockchain tech and works for anyone who is already on their platform. But can get this clarity if someone really needs this information..
23/12/24, 20:52 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Any connects in Spring Verify?
23/12/24, 20:54 - Sanaah Jain HR Executive Rigi: Vidyush Springverify.vcf (file attached)

24/12/24, 09:11 - Akshatha B Raj HR ObjectWin Technology: Hey folks need a quick input 

We had hired a intern for a marketing role duration 3 months but post 3 months she expressed her interest in different role - we offered internship for the role she was interested in for duration of 2 months.

Her internship ending today - but we need 1 more month to evaluate her completely, we wanted to extend her internship by a month - but now the intern is not comfortable extending her internship. How can we retain her in this case? <This message was edited>
24/12/24, 09:34 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Do you want to give a full time post evaluation?
If yes did you inform the same to her?
24/12/24, 09:37 - Akshatha B Raj HR ObjectWin Technology: Yes, has a good chances of conversion- we have informed her too but she’s not comfortable to extend her internship now. We won’t be able to offer her full time at the moment. 

Is there any alternative for this?
24/12/24, 10:04 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: It all depends on the intern. There is nothing else anyone can do. Plus if you think of it from the intern's perspective, they have been interning for 5 months.
24/12/24, 10:58 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: I have a solution, Talk to the intern and give her a hike in her Stipend (closer to what you will offer her for a fulltime role) and a fulltime offer from next month
24/12/24, 11:00 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: while talking to her, you can tell that most companies do not offer a change in role during internship
24/12/24, 11:02 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Nothing much like Clive said 
5 months is a good period 
So the team will have to make the decision or let go
As she might be unsure of conversation 
One thing that you can do is give it in writing and see if it helps boost her confidence subjected to performance in 1 month <This message was edited>
24/12/24, 11:15 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: You can extend her internship for couple more months with good hike
24/12/24, 11:36 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: You can offer a contractual role enabling a better salary for her to stay and convert later
24/12/24, 11:49 - Varun Kapadia Asst Manager Checkmate: Offer her full time role with a probation period of 3 months.
24/12/24, 12:03 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: This works better

We’re actively working on improving gender diversity within the organization and are focusing on increasing the top-of-funnel (TOFU) metrics across various hiring pipelines.

Here are a few ideas we’ve brainstormed so far:

1. Attractive Referral Campaigns
2. Gender-Coded Job Descriptions
3. Enhanced Careers Page
4. Partner with Women-Focused Networks

Would love to know your thoughts on these or if you have any additional suggestions/ideas that has worked out for you.
08/01/25, 16:22 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: Conducting a recruitment drive specifically for women candidates with career breaks could be a good option to consider.
08/01/25, 18:13 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: I try to have a balance at all interview stages (50-50) and when I do an active outreach, focus solely on sourcing female candidates. 

Also, set realistic goals with your hiring teams. Eg. 50-50 in Engineering is not possible because your college ratios are at 35-405 females.
08/01/25, 18:16 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: When it comes to diversity, we stop at gender diversity and women with career break. Why can't this be also for men and other genders? 🤔 and also add other diversity factors beyond gender...
08/01/25, 18:23 - Varun Kapadia Asst Manager Checkmate: Tapping into Women only talent pool by collaborating with companies like HerKey can be a good option.
08/01/25, 18:48 - Swapna Kole: I didn't have a great outcome from HerKey

22/01/25, 15:32 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: If you are catering to certain clients it’s needed and for the company’s own safety
22/01/25, 15:32 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Not Mandatory.... but if you are getting compliance certifications and if the employee works for any BFSI client, then it is needed
22/01/25, 15:34 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Not mandatory however if you have b2b clients, they could mandate it, before sometime is deployed to their projects (more IT services) or it could be cases where it's consumer facing & the impact of not doing a background check could be severe - ola or uber drivers..
22/01/25, 15:52 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Its required for audit per se, and certification (like ISO, or Hippa, Or pci dss) which depends on the kind of business you are in.
22/01/25, 15:59 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: I would recommend you to get this done, along with initial BGV as it may not cost much

27/01/25, 20:43 - Varsha Singh HR Manager INDMoney: Hi Everyone,

I wanted to gather some insights on an industry-specific query. What is the standard practice followed when an employee joins an organization but leaves immediately within 2-3 days (usually citing reasons like receiving a better offer or being in the final stages of another interview process before joining)?

Specifically, I’m curious to know:

Are such cases considered as formal employment and recorded in the system?
Is there a probationary clause that comes into play in such situations?
What are the common practices regarding salary payouts, documentation, and relieving formalities?


It would be great to hear your thoughts or learn about how your organization approaches this scenario. Looking forward to your input!
27/01/25, 21:29 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: If the employee has not been formally onboarded, you can revoke the offer and close the case.

If onboarding is complete and the employee's details are recorded, termination clauses can be applied for immediate exit without salary, provided they violated the agreement. However, if the employee worked even briefly and raises a labor dispute, it could become an issue.

The best approach is to discuss and resolve the matter amicably with employee as this will be an issue later on for them if there is a background check. If employee agrees, avoid recording the employment details. If the employee insists on salary, ask them to resign formally, serve the notice period as per the probation clause, and process their salary, PF, TDS, etc and issue a relieving letter.

We at Quizizz Inc. are looking to revamp/restructure the compensation structure for GTM teams in 2025. Is there anyone here ideally from a SaaS organisation that can shed some light & share some ranges with levels? A small goodie bag awaits 😁
Please DM me if you can help. Looking forward to connect and learn more!
04/02/25, 18:18 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Need the group's inputs:

In startups building scalable products, is the pool of Senior Backend Developers larger for Node.js and Java compared to Python? If so:

Are Node.js, and Java engineer compensations typically lower than Python?
Is hiring faster for Node.js/Java developers?
What are typical budget ranges for Node.js and Java and Python developers?

Thanks in advance

I need some help or reference to understand the hiring process generally followed in Analytics heavy (product) companies for a data analyst or senior analyst kind of roles 
Within 1 to 2 and 2 to 5 years of experience
04/02/25, 20:31 - Vanshika Rawat Sr. Recruiter Axion Ray: Let me know if anyone can share some insights on this
04/02/25, 20:34 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Pradeep Rajesh Mundlik.vcf (file attached)
04/02/25, 20:57 - Varsha Singh HR Manager INDMoney: Hey anyone here from Pepperfy or Viacom18 ?
04/02/25, 21:10 - Suyash Kumar: Can you also share the context please?
04/02/25, 21:19 - Shraddha Agrawal HR Manager ClearFeed: I disagree here, since I hire mostly for Node.js dev for both freshers and senior roles in a start up. I often find it challenging to find quality candidate with JS experience and most of the top tier talent in our case for senior dev (in terms of their previous exp and project) have come from python background and have cracked out 3 rounds of tech interviews better than other folks from Java and JS. But we have also been able to find good JS candidates. So can’t say depends on the pool you are getting and the overall candidature than the tech stack solely. 

Also, salary here has nothing to do with the language but rather on the job role and requirement. 
- Say if the dev is required only to do maintenance  work and small fixes then their salary band could be lower than other devs who are building the product or features from scratch and handling the whole software architect, and supervising junior devs. <This message was edited>
04/02/25, 21:29 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If you are still seeking inputs,feel free to DM
04/02/25, 21:37 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: - Backend developers in Java is definitely larger than Node.js/ Python even today. 
- Compensation is based on his expertise in one or more multiple stack, analytical and logical thinking and ofcourse on the kind of products development he waz involved in, understanding of the domain, learning capabilities etc etc....
This has been my exp. In the previous startup that I worked, we were hiring language agonistic but for Java , we have to hire from the same language given its vast and depth...
04/02/25, 22:46 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: I can help with Pepperfry . What’s the context here ?

Can someone help on guidelines or documents overview on what all can we present in People MBR (monthly business review) to the leaders in the company
05/02/25, 11:52 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Is this first MBR?
05/02/25, 11:52 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Can you elaborate on the context?
05/02/25, 11:53 - Vishal S Sr. Manager TA Jupiter: It's for OND and Jan as a team it's a first time we will do it
05/02/25, 11:55 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Ond?
05/02/25, 11:59 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: I'm guessing Oct, Nov, Dec quarter?
05/02/25, 12:02 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: I read this as organisation development!
05/02/25, 12:12 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: This message was deleted
05/02/25, 12:27 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Adding what we did though it might differ from company to company on HR initiatives & Challenges:

1. Hiring Status : Offers made, Drop ratio, Joinings, Talent Pipeline, New Hiring requests and budgets required.
2. Attrion data
3. eNPS if  employee engagement surveys were done
4. Any employee feedbacks/concerns that mgmt should be aware of
5. Bonus / Performance pay / Successions planned.
6. Compliance related updates and Risk mgmt if any
7. Glassdoor/ Google review ratings or any other employer branding metrics
8.  New initiatives if required from People function and its impact, budgets required.

Hope this helps👍 <This message was edited>
05/02/25, 13:39 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: MBR are totally metrics driven, considering this is your first review you should take structured approach likewise, some of the slides can be as backup slides for subsequent meetings. 

1) Set the Context - Process Area/Function area/Project information, Team details, process flow, Scope, timelines etc.
2) Key Metrics - Yearly Targets --> followed by Quarterly Target.   
3) Target vs Actual Current Progress with supporting bullet points on key highlights of actual progress. Drawing some color codes R/B/Y to bench mark progress status is impactful
4) For Major Metrics drivers consider Highlighting them separately.  For Ex - out of $100 budget, $30 is consumed by XYZ, $ 20 by PQR
5) Action Plan for next quarter
6) Challenges anticipated with Mitigation Plan.  Do not forget to call out of support required if any.
05/02/25, 14:12 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: Hi Folks,
We are planning to transition from 4 level rating system (Does not meet expectations, Meets expectations, Exceeds expectations and Exceptional)  to 5 level rating system 
1. Needs Development
2. Often Meets Expectations
3. Sometimes Exceeds Expectations
4. Always Exceeds Expectations
5. Exceptional / Sets a new Standard
Needed inputs from you all who are already on a 5 level rating system if this is running well in your org?
Is having Sometimes Exceeds expectations in 3rd place okay, and not taken as mean performance?
Needed guidance on pay for performance for these ratings.
Thank you folks🙏😇🫡
05/02/25, 14:21 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: What caused you to change it ?
05/02/25, 14:23 - Chinmaya B Head People & Culture Hyperverge: People who were just above meets expectations could not be placed in meets Or Exceeds expectations justfully. We wanted more granular assessment to help managers place a person appropriately.
05/02/25, 14:30 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: This message was deleted
05/02/25, 14:33 - Akarshita Mehra Sr. Recruiter InterviewVector: In my prev. org, we transitioned from a 5 to a 6 scale rating for the same reasons. As there was not enough clarity where to place the one who often met expectations.
Although, for us, 1 and 2 were both performance intervention ratings (1 having graver implications like PIP).
So far you do not want that distinction, this 5 scale rating seems fine so far it solves your purpose.
05/02/25, 14:33 - Vijin V R HR Rebid: Hi Team,
Any recommendations for recruitment agencies or partners to close a Business Development position with Advertisement and Marketing agency-specific experience.
05/02/25, 14:33 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: All my orgs we always used 5 star rating system 
Our logic was to have precise buckets in which folks can get added <This message was edited>
05/02/25, 15:01 - Fireside Shiffana MK: If the company size is less than 200 - I would keep the ratings simple and invest more in managers to have them evaluate performance fair and right + ensure right communication is reaching people. Adding more buckets in my opinion seems to be a surface level problem solving where bucket 3 and bucket 4 are quite based on intuitions and not math (eg: what is sometimes , what is always? - often its a feeling unless supported by % of cases which is hard to gage for all projects)

If manager investment and standardization is hard such as huge company size where HRBPs are few in number, may be such fixes help for sometime :)
05/02/25, 15:15 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Agree with this. We had simplified to 3 ratings:
- Needs Improvement
- Meets expectations
- Exceeds expectations
05/02/25, 15:15 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: More the options , more the confusion
05/02/25, 15:21 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: For similar reasons of keeping limited options for simplicity, we chose 4 levels:
- Way beyond expectations [Very few people get this]
- Above expectations
- ⁠Met Expectations
- ⁠Needs improvement
05/02/25, 15:23 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: How do we define this make it the game changer and this info should be with everyone at the beginning of the year so that they are aware of the evaluation process.

12/02/25, 09:11 - Nidhi Kumar HR Head Imagekit.io: Sourcing and screening:
Mass mailing and then to the interested candidates who responded, ask required details on mail, easy to filter by this way and then call only the best suited. Save the time to call everyone.
Job posting- again follow same approach to shortlist.
Interview Setup: 
Take 1-2 full day availability from panel and set as many interviews you can on those dates.
Interview rounds:
Ask panel to create a  questionnaire with minimum basic requirement to filter very poor candidates.
Keep assesment in second round to then filter the pool and proceed with required interview rounds. <This message was edited>

12/02/25, 12:21 - Namita Nambiar TA Groww: I’m looking to understand how different fintech and other companies handle employee trading compliance. Given the risk of insider trading, many firms restrict employees from trading on other platforms or impose specific guidelines.

I’d love to hear how your company approaches this—whether it’s through pre-clearance requirements, restricted lists, blackout periods, mandatory disclosures, or other measures. Any insights on industry best practices would be really helpful. <This message was edited>
12/02/25, 12:31 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Really interested query, following this
12/02/25, 12:34 - Jay Cred hR: you will need to find out someone who has worked with US companies. they would have deeper insights on this.
12/02/25, 13:26 - Kiran Ksheersagar Senior TA Specialist Arcesium: I am working in a similar domain.

During the onboarding process, candidates will go through  compliance training and they have to disclose their trading portfolios. We utilize designated brokers for the transfer of these portfolios.

Our trading requests are managed through a portal called StarCompliance. If an individual wishes to trade, they must submit a request via StarCompliance. Approval is typically granted within 15 minutes, provided the stock is not related to our which we are dealing with our clients (to avoid insider trading). Additionally, our policy prohibits intraday trading. Any stock purchased must remain in the portfolio for T+31 days.

I anticipate your next question may be about the consequences of failing to declare. During onboarding, employees sign a compliance form which authorizes audits. 

Annual audits are conducted for all employees.

26/02/25, 16:26 - Rashmi M TA Consultant GrowthX: Hey folks - need some inputs 

What are the expenses as a company we can consider while asking employees to relocate ? Like 
- Hotel for stay 
- ⁠travel 
How can we optimise on these expenses? 

Any inputs here appreciated 🙌🏼Thanks in advance.
26/02/25, 16:30 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: You should consider the services of packers & movers as well.
To optimize, one thing that I can think of is you can partner with some hotel(s) for a stay as they might give a corporate discount, rather than reimbursing every single employee (which shall be expensive), if this is a mass relocation requirement.
26/02/25, 21:19 - Nidhi Kumar HR Head Imagekit.io: 1. One time relocation allowance to cover their relocation expenses.
2. Initial 10-15 days stay arrangement
3. Travel cost
To optimize, you can use service apartments instead of hotels or partner with hotels to negotiate corporate rates. Do not give reimbursement for packers and movers and set a fix sum to be given as allowances.
26/02/25, 21:38 - Varun Kapadia Asst Manager Checkmate: Cost of Packers & Movers, Hotel cost for a week and Real estate agent cost reimbursement to the employee (since the employee won't get much time to hunt for a rented accommodation).

05/03/25, 11:17 - Nilesh Godle HR Consultant Thence: freshers? or some with sm experience?
05/03/25, 11:17 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: freshers
05/03/25, 11:18 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: It's generally 20 lpa+, depends from company to company as well
05/03/25, 11:18 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: 15 - 25 LPA is the usual range.
05/03/25, 11:19 - Nilesh Godle HR Consultant Thence: min 15+ for decent candidate
05/03/25, 11:19 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: 20 lpa+ for freshers in early stage startups? people are rich these days. I was born in the wrong generation it seems 😢
05/03/25, 11:19 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: ISB will come a little more premium

05/03/25, 18:08 - Piyush Raghuvanshi: IMO - never hire a fresher for PM role, they shud be hired a Product Analyst first doing User Research, Insighting, Data Analysis, Prod Ops (PRDs story support) etc working cross functionally with Business / Growth & Engg 

their career growth framework and journey shud be - PA => APM => PM 
Comp should start & trend fwd - 12L++ => 15++ => 18-20L++
05/03/25, 18:12 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: hmmm. makes sense. I am thinking of hiring 6 months interns first for this. and if they are doing good, then only convert them
05/03/25, 18:13 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: one more question - 

Has anyone ever hired a founding sales person (BDR/Outreach specialist) in USA? Have few questions regarding that. And if the group permits, can ask those question here as well for general knowledge :)
05/03/25, 18:17 - Piyush Raghuvanshi: Use Gen AI bot or Co-Pilot or any agency ... not worth hiring at early GTM stage
05/03/25, 18:19 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: gen ai bot / co-pilot are not that much personalized. Happy to explore agency if there is a solid reference. DM'ing you :)

11/03/25, 14:54 - Akshatha B Raj HR ObjectWin Technology: Hey folks!

We’re transitioning from Work From Home (WFH) to Work From Office (WFO) in the coming weeks, and I’d love to get some insights on how your teams managed this shift.

A few key questions:

- How did you handle the transition process?
- What was the timeline given for employees to move to a 5-day office schedule?
- For employees based in other cities, how much time were they given to relocate?
- Were any handbooks or documents shared to guide them through the transition?
- What benefits or perks were offered to support employees during this change?

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! 😊
11/03/25, 16:48 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 1. CXO announcement, HRBP cascade, manager cascade, open convo on transition timeline but clear expectation setting.
2. ⁠Start with 3 days with rotating depts and then transition to full 5 days within 2 months of announcement 
3. ⁠3 months with some cases in 5-6 months due to extraneous circumstances around them (based on performance as well)
4. ⁠Yes, a 4 pager
5. ⁠Complete relocation assistance - flights and 10 day accommodation for city transition for full family (booked by admin team) + relocation leave (3 days). Expecting parent employees given special session on transition in city. 
6. ⁠Going above and beyond requires making a list of collection of hottest restaurants, best schools near office, broker names and lists for office area nearby residential, tie ups and support from housing platforms like NoBroker for filing of brokerage slips that company reimburses within relocation kitty per person <This message was edited>

20/03/25, 16:37 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: *Hi all, please help me with this query*: Is it legally mandatory to provide Earned Leave (EL) in India? Our company currently offers only Casual Leave (CL) and Medical Leave (ML). Also, since we do not provide EL, should we explicitly mention in employee agreements that leave encashment is not applicable, or is it sufficient to include this in our leave policy?
20/03/25, 16:43 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Hi All, 

Small suggestion required from you:

One of the process owner has asked to revoke the offer at the late stage (a day before the candidates last working in his current company) asking to revoked the offer due to management meeting and change in the hiring. 

How to sensitively handle this? (This impacts the brands reputation and candidates situation) <This message was edited>
20/03/25, 16:49 - Rohit Vatsyayan TA Head SwiffyLabs: No EL is not mandatory , any form of leave is okay
Atleast from what I know Karnataka mandates to have sort of leave encashment or carry forward every year (although companies have liberty to structure it in their own way)
Hence companies use EL as only type of leave covered in encashment/carry forward
20/03/25, 16:51 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Currently, we have this structure:
Casual leave - can carry forward up to 6 days every year
Medical leave - can not carry forward
20/03/25, 16:51 - Rohit Vatsyayan TA Head SwiffyLabs: Then it’s sorted and compliant
20/03/25, 16:51 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Thanks a lot!
20/03/25, 17:37 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If you have to be labour law compliant, EL is mandatory. As per the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, every employee is entitled to annual leave with wages at the rate of one day for every twenty days of work performed by an adult employee and one day for every fifteen days of work performed by a young person.
20/03/25, 17:38 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Employees can carry forward up to 45 days of unused Earned Leave, providing flexibility for future use. At the end of employment, any unused Earned Leave is encashable, ensuring employees don’t lose the benefit of their accrued time off.
20/03/25, 17:40 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: All this will be caught during labour law audits or if an employee complains to labour law dept. However the leave clauses needs to be mentioned in the  policies and agreements.
20/03/25, 17:45 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I knew thiz for sure as I had faced 3 labour audits from labour dept and during which we had consulted the labour law expert... <This message was edited>
20/03/25, 17:51 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: EL is statutory requirement
20/03/25, 17:56 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Leave encashment are part of exit mostly, carry forward is YOY thing.  You can add this as part of HR round of discussion for new hire. Rest details can be part of your policy document.  You have to be legally compliant.
20/03/25, 17:58 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Okay, thanks for inputs everyone!

With this, I also recall one more thing. Some companies mention that they do not provide leave encashment as they do not have the policy or they provide unlimited leaves. Is it legal? I have seen this in 2 companies, one is a start up, and one is an MNC.
20/03/25, 17:59 - Fireside Shiffana MK: I can help! Quick call or voice note ?
20/03/25, 18:01 - Fireside Shiffana MK: If unlimited leaves given, labour office is usually fine with it. I have managed that with them for some good 3 years straight with 4-5 audits. 
Encashment is not stringent - you can get away with that too. 

What is critical is if yiu have a structured leave policy, then 18 days of earned leave + 12 days of sick leave for tenured employees is roughly expected in karnataka.
20/03/25, 18:02 - Fireside Shiffana MK: What is more critical is identifying what will keep your team motivated and balancing that with law. Being compliant alone is not helpful in terms of building a culture imo
20/03/25, 18:02 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Giving you a call!
20/03/25, 18:10 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Yes, please
20/03/25, 18:11 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We did the same but we were advised that of we have to be complaint then just be it or you may be lucky enough to get away with it. 

Leaving aside all these Statuory things, think from the point of what is the risk for business, what is beneficial to people..take a call on it.

Govt only manadates businesses to give the basic to employees. If the company is giving more, it doesn't ask.

02/04/25, 11:40 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Hello peeps, here's a trivial question (which came to my mind while I was talking to a just-passed out-from-college and highly arrogant founder) 

"Till how many hires the founder should be involved in the hiring process?"

Asking since the founder (mentioned above) says that they would like to be involved till the team becomes 500 (currently it's at 10). To this I honestly thought that it's too much for a founder to focus on hiring till 500 and not focusing on scaling the ops, customer base (I may be wrong in my thinking) 

Putting forward this question to the group. Thoughts?
02/04/25, 11:42 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: I have seen early stage founders getting involved till 100. Up to 50 is usually high involvement.
02/04/25, 11:42 - Muneera Ghosh TA Manager Captain Fresh: I feel the founder should be involved in the initial set of hirings and also for  leadership hiring, apart from that I feel founders should be more focussed in scaling the app and operations
02/04/25, 11:42 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Exactly, 500 is too over done! Arrogance at it's peak
02/04/25, 11:57 - Rohit Vatsyayan TA Head SwiffyLabs: After 50 they will stat becoming the bottleneck
It’s seems there is lack of maturity and fundamentals 
Running a tight ship= no final say other than founders is becoming a trend <This message was edited>
02/04/25, 11:58 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: He'll get a reality check in a few months
02/04/25, 12:00 - Gaurav Uniyal TA Head 91Squarefeet: Not more than 100, I think. Can be involved in senior leadership hiring or expansion hiring.
02/04/25, 12:05 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Depends on how fast the intended expansion to 500 people is. If over 2-3 years and above, sure. If within 6 months-1 year, then no. It really depends on what the person is looking for in these set of people. 500 is not a lot if growth is measured and organic.
02/04/25, 12:06 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Level of involvement is the real problem. because if they're micromanaging beyond the first 20 people, then it's already a bottleneck. so scale is not the real problem
02/04/25, 16:10 - Anupama Murthy Founder AVS Technology & Talent Consulting: Generally they get involved till they are 50 or so and after that he will not have anytime to interview. He may not be arrogant but it’s all the initial enthusiasm that’s making him say that. You can tell him that it’s great that he wants to get involved and leave it at that. Anyway when they grown eventually he can take a call. How does it matter now? <This message was edited>
02/04/25, 16:18 - Divya Chethan Founder CBREX: As a founder myself, I think it would probably be around 50. Its not scaleable otherwise. Maybe a max of upto 100. Then its your direct reportees who hv to manage and imbibe the same culture within the team
02/04/25, 16:20 - Divya Chethan Founder CBREX: But its extremely important to warm up the core team and the 1st 6-9 months  from their induction is crucial
02/04/25, 16:27 - Nidhi Kumar HR Head Imagekit.io: I think, its not about the number of people but the role you are hiring for. I worked with founders who loves to interview leadership or some sort of senior folks also after we acheived 450 employee strenght.
02/04/25, 16:29 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Leadership is still fine, there the involvement is still required. This even large enterprise will also follow. Not for every role.
02/04/25, 17:31 - Ritika Sharma Sr. TA Partner Hackerrank: Founders' involvement in hiring decisions may stem from a lack of trust in their leadership team rather than arrogance. but to scale effectively, founders should empower their leaders to make hiring decisions for their respective orgs. It's understandable for founders to want to be involved in certain critical roles, such as product or leadership positions but beyond that is not scalable.

A possible solution is for founders to review candidates' overall scorecards or get involved at the offer approval stage. This allows them to stay informed about the strengths each new hire brings to the team without being overly involved in every hiring decision. our founder operates in this manner and it is working fine.
03/04/25, 09:47 - Neha Sahi Trell HR: Catching up on this thread a little late, but couldn’t resist jumping in!

Echoing what a few folks have already shared — in the early days, the founder’s involvement in hiring is super valuable. It helps shape culture, attract early believers, and build momentum. But staying involved in every hire till 500? That feels like overkill and honestly a recipe for burnout.

A more scalable approach is:
- Founder drives hiring till ~30–50,
- Stays involved in leadership roles till ~100–150,
- Then shifts focus to building a strong hiring engine with the right people and systems.

Founders should aim to hire people they trust to carry the culture forward, not stay stuck in the loop themselves. Otherwise, they risk being the bottleneck rather than the multiplier.

Really loved reading everyone’s perspectives on this!
03/04/25, 11:50 - Kunal Banerjee TA Specialist Freshworks: Thank you all for the perspective, basically i was correct in my thought process. 500 is a big number, sooner or later actual realisation will happen in the mind of the founder. That can show the founder to be a macro manager, which it actually sounded when I was talking to him. Max 50 is perfectly well, and then move the focus towards leadership hiring later on. 

Thank you all!

11/04/25, 08:46 - Fireside Sayana Dutta: Early morning waking up to such a story is very distressing, another woman who has put open to work tag around her profile. One sexual harassment case, and a woman is left looking for an opportunity, floundering with self doubt, loss of time and effort and most importantly money and in certain cases it can cost her career too. Many women don't even get re hired owing to social stigma. It's important that we don't do POSH as a tick mark activity.

14/04/25, 14:58 - Reena P Sr. HR 56 Secure: Hi folks, quick question - asking on behalf of a friend.
Is it legally permissible for a company to lay off a female employee during the early stages of her pregnancy in India?
Would appreciate any insights on what the law says around this.
14/04/25, 15:00 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I think you can check but in my understanding it’s not legally permissible to lay off during pregnancy
14/04/25, 15:01 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Depends 
The answer is not clear 
As if she was on pip and records were kept then they can 
But if not then clearly they can not fire as it will go under the differentiation account
But even in this case they can put her on pip if she’s a low performer <This message was edited>
14/04/25, 15:02 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Even if they terminate - they hv to pay mat benefits
14/04/25, 15:02 - Divya Vn Sr. HR Ex-Moolya: But BPO's generally fire pregnant employees in their first trimester without any benefits.
14/04/25, 15:03 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Folks can do case on them and their shop act can be pulled out
14/04/25, 15:03 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: That’s so unethical
14/04/25, 15:04 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: The only exception in my understanding is gross misconduct 
Rest all don’t really apply as per law
14/04/25, 15:04 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: +1
14/04/25, 15:06 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Iv managed 2 cases in past for pip 
It all depends on the timeline of announcement
14/04/25, 15:06 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: One case we extended the over all process by 18 months Cz of the communication timeline
14/04/25, 15:06 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Other case we could let go as we had informed the employee before she could announce it to us 
Out of good will we paid full notice <This message was edited>
14/04/25, 15:08 - Neha Sahi Trell HR: Was the concerned person employed for a year or more for the mat benefits to kick in? If not termination is applicable.
14/04/25, 15:10 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Neha act states 80 working days in the  12 months before pregnancy date hits
14/04/25, 15:11 - Neha Sahi Trell HR: Sorry that’s a typo, I’m meant 80 days in a year
14/04/25, 15:13 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: 3 major reasons -
Gross misconduct 
Contract expiry ( till her contract is valid you need to give, beyond that not required by law)
Non compliance with company rules ( this is where pip and other causes sit but very slippery slope )

16/04/25, 09:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: R u using any payroll tool? Normally they list all these tax saving allowances that you can have as part of your rewards strategy. I am using your Q waz towards having such an allowance az part of your comp structure. 

Not heard of this but yes there is research allowance. Normally these allowances are mapped to the industry and role u r part of.
16/04/25, 09:44 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Yes 
That Iv already done 
This has come over and above that when we did research
16/04/25, 09:45 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Better check with CA. I dont see it listed on income tax website too
16/04/25, 09:45 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Done 
He’s not aware :)
This is under sec 10(16)
But interpretation is dicy
16/04/25, 09:47 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: It says this
Here, it is important to understand that the basis of exemption is that the scholarship income should have been used to meet the education expenses.

16/04/25, 09:48 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: already read this <This message was edited>
16/04/25, 09:48 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Need input from some1 who’s implemented it
16/04/25, 09:48 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: As employees our    income is not scholarship is my primary doubt...
16/04/25, 09:49 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Use case is child Tution fees / scholarship
16/04/25, 09:49 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Education allowance
16/04/25, 09:50 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Use case that I see is companies encouraging employees to study or on sabatical to do research.
16/04/25, 09:50 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Have you implemented in past ?
16/04/25, 10:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Nope. It was not relevant for our industry

16/04/25, 12:06 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: try this article, I have not come across usecase though. I am a payroll expert, but not implemented this.
16/04/25, 12:07 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: Q.3 What kind of scholarship is eligible for exemption under Section 10(16)?

All kinds of scholarships, including those granted by the government, educational institutions, or any other organization, are eligible for exemption under Section 10(16).
16/04/25, 12:08 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: it says above though it depends on how much is the quantum, what is the mechanism, judiciousness of how this is spent, these are the things you will need to show it to Income tax authorities if the scrutiny arises. Can you prove it appropriately or only a way to save tax for employees has to be clear. DM me and we can connect so I can help you on this
16/04/25, 12:10 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yup. Good point. Scholarship income is not taxed basically but is not applicable to companies. Probably for education university employees it may be
16/04/25, 12:11 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: not for companies at all it is for the employee or individual
16/04/25, 12:11 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: cant think of why would company get a scholarship, company would get grant
16/04/25, 12:13 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I am working for which I am getting salary plus I am doing research in a govt approved org for which I am getting scholarship too.  In this case scholarship money will not be taxed
16/04/25, 12:31 - Nataraja Nanjundaiah Credit Audit Payroll Expert: ideally not taxed. need to refer to the section in detail. these are rare cases so many CAs or Payroll experts would struggle to confirm. but we have to understand the tax rules and make firm stance so that if scrutiny is there we are able to explain
16/04/25, 12:31 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yup.

Do you feel the candidate expectations have come down , what are the reasons you have observed that’s driving their decision to join a company, throw some light on what are you experiencing from TA pt of view , esp as SDE 2 / tech lead level
22/04/25, 18:50 - Shweta Gupta HR Head AirMDR: yes, candidates expectations are low + nobody is paying 50-60% hike. reasonable hike like - 20-30% you can give
22/04/25, 18:50 - Shweta Gupta HR Head AirMDR: I recently close 5 positions almost with similar numbers
22/04/25, 18:50 - Piyush Raghuvanshi: 1. Quality of work (AI fomo)
2. ⁠Job stability (prod & fund)
3. ⁠More trust on cash vs stocks / bonus 
4. ⁠Flexible on WFO / Hybrid if comp is decent or else low comp but remote
22/04/25, 19:08 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Expectations are fairly reasonable unless the candidate is speaking to larger orgs/GCCs - in such cases most start-ups are not able to match/compete.

22/04/25, 20:08 - Piyush Raghuvanshi: That depends on what exactly you’re looking for 

1. Tech stacks (new age vs old/primitive ones) 
2. ⁠industry agnostics or open to all 
3. ⁠competition only or prod/service/what not <This message was edited>

22/04/25, 20:13 - Piyush Raghuvanshi: Counter offers trend has seasonality, focus on what you have in control or what you can influence …  you won’t achieve anything by this market intel (it won’t let you increase your budget or ranges or postpone your hiring)
22/04/25, 20:14 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: At Headout, here's how it is: 

For SSE/SDE-2, the range is broad 30-50L cash (so for 3 yrs exp, would be 30-35L, 4 yrs would be 35-40L, 5 yrs would be 40-45L, 6 yrs would be 45-50L) + ESOPs (which is capped at 0.25x of their cash component)
For Lead/SDE-3, it's in the range of 50-65L + ESOPs. 

* with exceptions in some cases

Joining bonus is given in some cases.

22/04/25, 20:34 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thanks Pallavi
22/04/25, 22:53 - Yaswanth Goteti Head Of People Fincent: Quick - silly question — do background verification agencies have any tools or special access that allow them to identify the number of companies an individual has worked with, without revealing the specific organization names? Can they track overall employment history independently of what the candidate discloses? - *asking on behalf of a friend. *

23/04/25, 10:43 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: What has been your exp Neha?
23/04/25, 10:43 - Reena P Sr. HR 56 Secure: Through metamorph
23/04/25, 10:44 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Metamorph salary report is also a good reference point to start
23/04/25, 10:45 - Manikanta Reddy HR Inito: This for mobile development and backend dev.

On top of benchmarking we also consider the company financials and then come up with compensation for a role we can offer. When ESOP come into picture it’s always valuation game.
23/04/25, 10:45 - Reena P Sr. HR 56 Secure: We got it done explicitly for our company.
23/04/25, 10:46 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Defining roles, making KSA skills, defining criticaltilty of the role and comparing market data to these competencies in our domain and business where we want to attract talent from <This message was edited>
23/04/25, 10:47 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yup I got it. In general that report is good is what I mentioned 👍

I too waz talking to them previously
23/04/25, 10:53 - Vikas Sawant Sr. TA CommerceIQ: Market is better and TA have upper hand now,
SDE 2 market is little competitive but if you move fast and have right engagement your decline ratio will reduce.

For Tech lead level we don’t see much competition or candidates coming with competing offers as this would be senior folks they are giving weightage to quality of work and flexibility (like hybrid setup)
23/04/25, 10:55 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Hiring is good in general and always competitive in 2 to 8 yrs exp bracket. Above 8 .. is  less openings <This message was edited>
23/04/25, 12:04 - Nidhi Kumar HR Head Imagekit.io: Can anyone suggest HR salaries for a B2B SaaS Startup.

Also in case anyone is hiring head Hr at 10-12 years in B2B saas startup

23/04/25, 12:09 - Nidhi Kumar HR Head Imagekit.io: Business partners. Career graph leading to head HR
23/04/25, 12:14 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Hey Kumuda
I see declines have reduced but it’s periodical in nature .
Sde 2 , sde 3 people still come back with counter offers 
I feel the driving factor for them is still money <This message was edited>
23/04/25, 12:19 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: The reason I asked this question is certainly drop outs hv reduced but not reduced to an extent that proves the claim that market is bad and people are not getting offers
However since last one year I have been constantly hearing market is only going to get worse but in reality I don’t see that happening
23/04/25, 12:20 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: Even we have seen this
Counter offers (multiple offers)
23/04/25, 12:21 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah criteria’s I know wanted to understand if they explored external help

23/04/25, 12:47 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: I am surprised to see such response . 

My team is unable to on-board one resource for Sr Dotnet Backend developer for last 4 months . 
So far  5 declines 🥲. Most of them quoted not interested for work from office . 

We paid 6 years guy with 33 lacs + stocks . Still no luck :( . Any suggestions around this.
23/04/25, 12:51 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Hey Sam, hiring .NET folks has always been challenging and there only few good developers left
23/04/25, 12:55 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hi All
Need to understand what interview process early-stage startups (Seed to Series A funded) follow to hire senior folks in the company.
This is for a Business Partnership role with us. Except for the founder, we don't have a very senior team in the company at the moment.

Any recommendations would be helpful.
23/04/25, 12:55 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Thanks Sridharan .
23/04/25, 12:56 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Peer Discussion + Assignment + Founders + Investor, incase of CXO roles
23/04/25, 12:57 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Add a couple of Stakeholders too
23/04/25, 12:57 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Also, depends on the role
23/04/25, 13:00 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Thanks Shiv!
23/04/25, 13:14 - Dipesh Jain AVP Talent Elevation Capital: Assignment should be in-depth. Additionally, you can get them evaluated by industry leaders
23/04/25, 14:56 - Mehvish K HR Head Travelwings: Hi all,
Are there any employee monitoring tools (Eg. Prohance) your respective companies are using that you'd strongly recommend. It should have the flexibility of integrating multiple time zones and remote teams. Appreciate your help.

23/04/25, 16:16 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Thanks please share .
24/04/25, 08:17 - Guntaas Lotay Sr. Recruiter Headout: Hey folks, did some research and thought of sharing here for everyone’s benefit:

1. Looked at two types of organisations to benchmark our bands with - ones that have commission based roles (DoorDash, eBay) versus others that have subscription based AE roles (Salesforce, Zendesk). Selling in the first bucket is relatively easier because you only make money if the partner business does (in this case, restaurants listed on DoorDash).
2. ⁠The general split between base and OTE in commission based roles is 75:25 whereas in subscription selling is closer to 50:50.
3. ⁠For the subscription based AE roles, the quotas for AEs are generally about 5x of their compensation. For eg: an AE who draws 100K USD will roughly have a target to sell contracts worth 500K in a year.

Are there any more suggestions on this one??
24/04/25, 10:43 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: What I have seen is Founder -> Subject Matter Expert -> Investor (if the role is critical and there are not many senior folks in the team). Real time case study solution + presentation could be an additional step.
24/04/25, 10:57 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: I have added my thoughts and structured them with the help of Chatgpt.

*1. Founder-Led Search (Warm Intros)*
Often, senior hires come through the founder’s personal network or investor introductions.

This route is fast, trust-based, and ensures cultural alignment—especially when there's no structured leadership team in place yet.
Investors or advisors can play a strong role in vetting these candidates.

*2. Define the Role and First-Year Outcomes*
*Create a clear JD and 30-60-90 day plan focused on business outcomes, not just responsibilities.
*Define Year 1 OKRs aligned with company goals—this helps both in interviews and in setting expectations.
*Think in terms of "what problem are we hiring this person to solve?"

*3. Structured Founder + Panel Interviews*
Founders should do at least 2 rounds:

1st round: Vision alignment, business understanding.
2nd round: Execution mindset, team building, decision-making.
3rd round (optional): Deep dive into domain knowledge and prior experience.

*4. Bring in External Experts (VCs, Advisors, CXOs)*
If your company doesn’t yet have senior folks internally, bring in domain or function-specific leaders from:
Your VC’s portfolio companies
Trusted industry connections
Paid expert panels (if needed—₹5K–₹15K per session is reasonable for CXOs' time)
These experts provide functional depth checks, red flags, and help avoid "founder blind spots."

*5. Case Study or Assignment (Optional but Powerful)*
Share a real business problem and see how the candidate would approach it. This gives deep insight into:
Strategic thinking
Stakeholder management
Business judgement

*6. Discreet Reference Checks*
Do 3–4 backchannel reference checks, beyond the names the candidate provides.
Focus on execution style, team management, and why they left past roles.
If any red flags arise, discuss them transparently with the candidate.
24/04/25, 11:05 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: That's helpful, thanks Shiv! <This message was edited>
24/04/25, 11:05 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Thanks Mitali!
24/04/25, 11:23 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Detailed one. Challenge that I have seen in the past while hiring these senior roles first time is that the Org will not have much clarity, many a times we want this person to figure out in depth and solve. Also 6 rounds is a lot , isn't it?

Competencies required for this role and how and who is measuring it the interview rounds is important while objectively looking at hire or no hire in the end. 

Bringing in the external expert as suggested is good. 

Any hiring will be easy if we know what are the "must skills" and what are the "good to have skills"
24/04/25, 11:26 - Basant Mishra HR Partner MoEngage: <Media omitted>
24/04/25, 11:30 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: In early stages when we had to hire for such roles, it definitely started from the Founder chat first. In our case there were 1-2 more senior leaders so they would be involved too. 

Something we also actively did was to have other team members be the part of the process not necessarily for them to vote but to know about their experience of interacting with this senior person. Eventually this person will have to work with other members closely so it made sense to know what they thought about their interaction style. 

We sought support of our investors in doing one round of conversation at the end.

29/04/25, 13:01 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: It's supposed to be a mandatory holiday, May day.
29/04/25, 13:01 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Yes, it’s mandatory actually
29/04/25, 13:02 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: Complain to the labour department 😃
29/04/25, 13:05 - Rupali Sharma HR Matrix Partners: 1st May is not a National holiday but comes under the purview of State holidays ( Karnataka includes 1st May as a public holiday). Hence, not a mandatory law across states. Hence, also if you see the central holiday list for 2025, it's not part of the mandatory holiday list.

02/05/25, 14:36 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Hi folks,
We’re dealing with a situation and would appreciate your thoughts. One of our employees, who is working remotely, has *suddenly resigned* over email without any prior discussion with her manager. *She is also not responding to our calls or messages.*

As per her agreement, she is required to serve a 60-day notice period. I’ve already replied to her resignation email, reminding her of this clause.

In case she continues to remain unresponsive, *what should be our next steps from an HR and compliance perspective*?

Thanks in advance for your inputs. <This message was edited>

05/05/25, 08:21 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: @⁨Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin⁩  - do you have policy around separation / absconding status? If its there treat this case accordingly.   Not reachable no prior notice is clear case of absconding!  However follow these steps, stop salary, stop end date flag in system.  Check how to handle pf with pf office as its legal deductible component.  If employee has maintained home address, emergency contacts person and phone number formally complete all connects save artifacts.  If employee is holding company laptop wait for formal timeline to be completed i think this will require police fir due to data privacy and security.  If u do not have such policies u should have one in place on priority! <This message was edited>

It’s for our foundation day in first week of June. Need a young energetic team who can fully engage our employees strength of 300 plus for full day.

05/05/25, 17:02 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Sure thanks much
05/05/25, 18:13 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Guys there is one open ended query that I have. For a rapidly growing tech startup (also having high attrition) what should be ideal % of TA Team in respect of total head count ? Is there a tentative number? I could not find anything on google. Chat gpt shared on lines of 2% plus 1% if there is high growth
05/05/25, 18:14 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Also on average I have mostly TA’s closing around 5-6 roles on a monthly basis. Average number. Tech non tech averaged out. No bulk hiring. Is my number ok ?
05/05/25, 18:14 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Define rapidly growing and define high attrition
05/05/25, 18:16 - Muneera Ghosh TA Manager Captain Fresh: Hi All,
Looking for a search firm who can help us in compensation benchmarking for Paris for manufacturing domain.
05/05/25, 18:16 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Need to add 500 people in the next 10 months we can say
05/05/25, 18:16 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: So a TA team accordingly
05/05/25, 18:16 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: No bulk hiring
05/05/25, 18:16 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Will you take agency support ?
05/05/25, 18:16 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes on and off. But focus will be to build the capability in-house v/s buying
05/05/25, 18:18 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: 1 team lead with ic heavy role with 3 senior recruiter ( 1 of these on contract to derisk last moments plan change )
2 mid exp recruiters ( 1 contract )
1 jr ( tech savvy to use ai driven tools to increase efficacy and do basic coord)

Assuming you have a ta leader <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 18:19 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: So contract can be pluk and remove setup when numbers start getting filled
05/05/25, 18:19 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: No TA leader. Have to hire one 😊 I just joined as hr head
05/05/25, 18:20 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Then add a ta leader to this chart and you can reduce 1 from other if ta leader dabbles  with some roles him / her self for senior hiring
05/05/25, 18:22 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Thanks 🙏🏻
05/05/25, 18:24 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes and structure can be defined as per the functions and reporting structures can be made accordingly
05/05/25, 18:24 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Thanks much
05/05/25, 18:25 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: If I were there then would leave some flexibility for the ta head as the human will have major onus of targets in this case
05/05/25, 18:26 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Ideally I would prefer him / her to join first 😊 and then decide the team structure and numbers
05/05/25, 18:27 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: But practically looking for roles parallely as year has started and we are struggling to support the business 🙌
05/05/25, 18:35 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: Can you help me with reason for high attrition? Unless you solve for this, number of TA in the team doesn't matter. Hope the firm doesn't have a revolving door policy.
05/05/25, 18:45 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: Agree to what Ajith asked. Until you identify the reason for attrition, you may not be able to define the size. You should also have a number defined as what rapidly means. I have seen a handful of smart recruiters doing 25- 30 now in a quarter to just 10- 15 in a quarter again averaged out. All of this depends on the quality of hire, total hc you plan to hire and in a controlled attrition.  If there is a leaking bucket scenario, no specific number of TA folks would be able to support 😊. Your TA head will need all of this information to arrive at tge ideal team structure too. <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 18:51 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Absolutely
05/05/25, 18:52 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: I am deep diving into the attrition reasons
05/05/25, 18:52 - Sonika Kariappa TA Executive Junglee Games left
05/05/25, 18:52 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Part of it is us being in logistics tech industry and front line sales
05/05/25, 18:53 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Front line sales faces high attrition. Rest of the org is fairly stable 😊
05/05/25, 18:53 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: No none of the doors are revolving 😀
05/05/25, 18:53 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Maybe due to unrealistic goals
05/05/25, 18:54 - Arvindh Murthy HR: Have seen this at byjus before
05/05/25, 18:55 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes exactly. I am double clicking at all possible data points.
05/05/25, 19:02 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: Just had a similar conversation with one of our portfolio founders on this. Requirement of 100+ folks in field sales and collections, but on company payroll.  Asked him to go with staffing model, ready talent availability, less overheads, onus of replacement lies with staffing firm. Easy to monitor performance, have a quarterly review, get high performers on company payroll and nurture. Candidates are also comfortable with staffing firms as they are assured of a job if the opportunity doesn't work out, this is not possible on a company payroll. Not every candidate can perform in different sales setup.
05/05/25, 19:06 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: Yes, true take a data driven decision for such a large scale / impact hiring
05/05/25, 19:11 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: So Iv done high volume on front line when i was with an Agritech
05/05/25, 19:11 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Very practical and flexible approach advice. 😊 We have been going with on company roll folks ever since org got founded.
05/05/25, 19:12 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: And it’s a 8 year old org so I guess moving now to staffing model will be tough
05/05/25, 19:12 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: As a change
05/05/25, 19:12 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Only 2 solutions to this -
1) pay higher than what the market pays 
2) referral pipeline and rehire ( campus helps a lot for training funnel )
05/05/25, 19:14 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes these two ideas will work. Rehiring is in works. Referrals we try to get as many as possible. Campuses we did but attrition happened. I am deep diving into it. Pay higher will have to check 🫣 <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 19:14 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Thanks a lot everyone
05/05/25, 19:14 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Yes so in my current role also we have frontline
05/05/25, 19:14 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: But as Ajith said we use external support in peak season to share the load
05/05/25, 19:15 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes that is always needed
05/05/25, 19:17 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: there is no single solution for hiring, why not do a pilot project for a small subset of candidates. Monitor and replicate if this succeeds.
05/05/25, 19:18 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes we have to be always flexible and open to ideas <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 19:19 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: Disagree on the first point, that's just throwing money at a problem and hoping it get solved. This will just create unhealthy competition and skewed market dynamics.
05/05/25, 19:21 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Just giving both options that I saw work in our case with retention
While not my fav but is something that worked for us as we had bundled this with benefits like mediclaim that most folks don’t do for frontline
05/05/25, 19:21 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: End game is that she will have to try all and see wht works for her org the best
05/05/25, 19:22 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: would agree if it is incentivized against performance/target achievement rather than on base pay.
05/05/25, 19:23 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: We had deviced ctc with a fixed base but non cap incentives, mediclaim and fast growth 
We did not hire some mid levels so they could grow in that role
05/05/25, 19:24 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: As for frontline folks simple things work more than fancy stuff 
We as LT would personally go on feild and spend time with a few of them to understand ground reality and fix from bottom
05/05/25, 19:24 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: So this is layer of what one can do 
It’s an onion 😜
05/05/25, 19:26 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: That's great
05/05/25, 19:29 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes we have a base salary plus good incentives plans plus medical insurance for all
05/05/25, 19:30 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Leaders are also well connected to the ground
05/05/25, 19:32 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: I am just a week old in the system. Need a major deep dive in the system 😊

08/05/25, 12:07 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Policy should be from campus and not student’s domicile
08/05/25, 12:07 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Rest same as laterals

08/05/25, 12:10 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: One of my earlier companies kept only hotel stay for 10 days but no relocation reimbursement
08/05/25, 12:10 - Bhavya Arora TTD: Folks, looking to pick some brains for anyone currently working in a remote setup. 

With a team within 300 to 1000 employees. Please reach out, if you are in Bangalore, drinks on Sprinto.
08/05/25, 12:11 - Swapna Kole: What difference will it make if we reverse the arrangements?
08/05/25, 12:14 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Relocation for entry level is usually 50k and hotel stay is usually just 15-20k (for 10 days) with partner hotels, so it’s just money saving. Most freshers don’t bring any furniture/movement items so hotel stay is needed more as well (new city, etc) <This message was edited>

Can someone help me with drafting the Gratuity policy ?
20/05/25, 12:42 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hey All
I have a question.

We are a Fintech startup (soon to be Series A) based out of Bangalore.
We are struggling to hire Tech (Backend) & Product (PM & Designers) at our organization. One of the major filters for us for these roles is pedigree, as we hire from tier-1 engineering colleges only.
Also, our team is quite small to conduct a large number of interviews to get a higher number of selections.

Any suggestions on what we can do about this? Please feel free to DM in case you have any suggestions or need further information to share some insights.

TIA
20/05/25, 12:50 - Fireside Navaneeth: Hey all,
Good day! Can anyone share me salary benchmarking for mechanical companies in India for 2025. TIA
20/05/25, 12:51 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: *My 2 cents:*
Go beyond the pedigree. If you’re open to hiring early career folks (1-2 yrs), look for people at startups similar to your stage or maybe one step ahead. These folks have experienced the ambiguous environment and understand how things work at an early stage. They would also have solved problems from scratch.
Collect a few basic technical questions from your team and ask candidates these questions at your level of the call. These could also be questions with binary responses. I also often asked my team to give me questions and also hints for how to know if the candidate is giving the answer in the right direction (b’cuz ofcourse these are technical questions, I would look for certain keywords they would use or approach they follow). This definitely reduced the rejections at the next stage.
Keep one round of technical interviews just for screening. Don’t invest a lot of time here but only max 45 mins where one of your engineers does this round. If the candidate doesn’t seem to be able to move the needle in the first 20-30 min, we would respectfully ask to close the call.

11/06/25, 11:56 - Vikas Sawant Sr. TA CommerceIQ: LinkedIn doesn’t allow a shared access as it recognises license with ip id’s and if there are multiple id it revokes the license.
So best option can be to try incognito mode
11/06/25, 12:00 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: LinkedIn does that only to accounts it’s not earning much from
11/06/25, 12:01 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I know companies with 50-60L contracts and 20 recruiters sharing 5 seats and LinkedIn not actually revoking anything. They just keep warning every meet that we’ve observed exploitation 😅😂
11/06/25, 12:05 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Agree with what Sukant said. If you plan to share the licenses do it smartly. Make sure that you communicate internally when someone is logging in to the recruiter account to ensure that another person is not logged out. Usually it shows a warning that they have detected another session, do you want to end the current one or the other session. 

I haven't seen the license being revoked so far.

12/06/25, 12:42 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: If you are going to tier 1, understanding which day slot we are getting gives great clarity on campus talent availability. Few other things could be like: 
- offer to joining ratios
- whzt are the campus conditions If we have to revoke offer ( worst possible)
- how many multiple offers a student can have?
- Placement coordination team in these campuses are of great help.
- How will you derisk with similar talent off campus incase of offer drops.
All the best 👍

18/06/25, 12:52 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Hi guys, how do you do independent references check for senior people before hiring in your organisations? Ofcourse this is apart from the general 3rd party formal background verification
18/06/25, 12:56 - Shilpi Sardana Head TA Netomi: Yes we always do. DM for more details. <This message was edited>
18/06/25, 12:58 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Message recruiter friends from that team who know that stakeholders’ standing. Or connect with people who’ve worked with that person before but not there anymore. These are always informal checks if the person is still there, can do a formal check if the person has left already and are free to join anyone.
18/06/25, 12:59 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I wouldn’t put too much worth in informal checks though. There’s always a person with negative outlook for the person or company, especially if they’re not together
18/06/25, 13:00 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Do the informal checks only for checking there’s no  POSH or integrity case against them
18/06/25, 13:02 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: If they have, you need to initiate a ERIR query via HRBP of that company. This needs to be formal, if the person has not declared the case themselves. This is still a grey area though. Many HRBPs reply that there was a case but won’t document it on mail lest they expose their company to risk
18/06/25, 13:02 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Just consider all these factors. Many others can add a lot of their exp too

This has become a nuisance right now 
Any suggestions 
We do ask them to share the screen during interviews but want to understand if something else is working for you all <This message was edited>
19/06/25, 08:56 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: To ensure authenticity, we request candidates to switch off their mobile phones during the interview and keep them away from the vicinity. We also conduct a discreet verification process where other team members may call the candidate to check if their phone is still off. This approach has helped us identify potential proxy candidates, and while some candidates have dropped out when informed of this process, it has proven effective in verifying candidate integrity.

22/06/25, 11:19 - Varun Kapadia Asst Manager Checkmate: Hi Team,

I would be interested to know what questions that we can ask the candidate during the recruiter screening call, so as to gauge whether the candidate is a good fit technically or not?
22/06/25, 12:00 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: For technical screening at the Recruiter stage, you should connect with your tech team to collect some basic questions and ideal responses to look for. Additionally, based on the stage of your company, you can evaluate using questions like - if they’ve end-to-end owned a module/feature and tell you about it, if they’ve to build>test>deploy themselves or there are different members on the team to do it, etc. <This message was edited>

23/06/25, 16:43 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Hello Team,

Just need one information and guidance.  One of the employee bluffed saying that her last drawn salary was 45k and asked hike of 50k but when we verified it wasn’t true.

She was just drawing 30k and our bad she was already hired in our company.

In such cases what can be done? 

Please provide inputs
23/06/25, 17:31 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: 1. While the discrepancy in the candidate’s declared (verbally) vs. actual salary, the increment from ₹30,000 to ₹50,000 still falls within a reasonable and acceptable range.
2. I believe,changing it won’t be fair to the employee, just ensure she performs well. Also she shared all her documents which was supposed to be checked by HR team. 
3. ⁠That said, this also highlights the importance of thorough document verification prior to extending offers. 
Just my POV

24/06/25, 11:38 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Hi all, can someone help me clear this doubt about payroll?

If an employee resigns and their new employer agrees to buyout their notice period, how do we calculate it?
- Should we consider calendar days or working days pay?
- Should we consider full monthly CTC in buyout or remove deductions like PF and more?
- Is there anything else we need to keep in mind in terms of compliances?
24/06/25, 11:40 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: - Notice is in Calendar days hence calendar
- Full CTC for those number of calendar days

27/06/25, 19:53 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hey Folks

Can you please help me with this data?
27/06/25, 20:00 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: There’s no typical ratio - every company has its own. To define it for yourself, you  need to hire SDE3 to lead certain projects and then you hire SDE1 & 2 to scale efforts and covers areas depending on gaps of the SDE3/lead
27/06/25, 20:01 - +91 91081 93009: I can
27/06/25, 20:03 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Maybe they can problem solve extremely well and link business but weak in infra so you hire a SDE2 with strong infra exp to cover that gap, but where that SDE2 needs to leave a hole too to pitch in more in a certain area you get a SDE1/2 with compliments skills. IC structure can’t be ratioed, completely depends on complexity of the problem being solved
27/06/25, 21:37 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Can you please let me know?
28/06/25, 12:35 - Rahul Goyal TA Lead APAC Yougov: Can somebody help on what's the best way to create an engagement plan for field sales people 1-5 yrs type of exp folks spread across multiple locations. Idea is to increase the retention and eventually reduce attrition and motivation of the sales staff
28/06/25, 12:40 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: +1
28/06/25, 12:40 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Looking for similar ideas. We are hiring a HRBP. till now had none
28/06/25, 12:45 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Hi Guys, I am planning to revamp the relocation policy in my organisation - Series C funded Tech Product startup in Ggn, mostly relocation cases would be tech product guys majorly or mid/ senior marketing, strategy folks per say. What kind of expense limits are being allocated for movement till they reach the joining location (Including tickets-self & family and freight movement). And once they reach how many days of stay is being covered by the organisation ? Also the claw back is for typically how many months ? Any inputs would be really helpful
28/06/25, 13:52 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: As a Series E funded unicorn, we offer comprehensive relocation support to new employees, which includes:
1. Economy class flight tickets for the employee and immediate family, 
2. Hotel accommodation for up to 15 days, 
3. ⁠Reimbursement for the relocation of household goods, including two-wheelers or four-wheelers. 
4. Cover brokerage charges incurred for securing rental accommodation. 
5. Relocation expenses for household goods, including 2-4 wheelers, are subject to a 12-month clawback period.
28/06/25, 13:55 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: is there a upper limit for this? or does the company have a tie-up with any relocation partner?
28/06/25, 13:56 - Kailuni Lanah HR TBC1: We don’t have partners, employees book it and reimbursed. Upper limit for household goods is 75K and 2-4 wheelers on actual <This message was edited>

28/06/25, 14:01 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Are and Pets covered?

28/06/25, 16:10 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Thanks
28/06/25, 16:10 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: For a unicorn it’s quite suitable 👍🏻
28/06/25, 17:18 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: There is no upper limit, all the above said leads to good budget
30/06/25, 13:11 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: HI Team, please share inputs from a smaller startup view.
30/06/25, 13:12 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: I am planning to revamp the relocation policy in my organisation - Series C funded Tech Product startup in Ggn, mostly relocation cases would be tech product guys majorly or mid/ senior marketing, strategy folks per say.

And once they reach how many days of stay is being covered by the organisation ? Also the claw back is for typically how many months ? Any inputs would be really helpful
30/06/25, 13:35 - Rajat Khanna Sr. TA Partner AiDASH: Let me ping you.
30/06/25, 13:35 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Hi
30/06/25, 13:35 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Ticketing, accommodation for 1 - 2 weeks (Hotel / PG) up on the role we are hiring for...incase if there family is shifting along with them then the relocation transportation charges ( 30k - 50k) one time along with ticketing for self and wife inclusive of child 

If the employee leaves within 180 days he or she needs to pay back all the expenses borne during the joining time
30/06/25, 13:37 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: We generally don’t hire out station folks considering higher chances of ditching in last minute ( the ratio is 2:5 ) 2 are joined or 3 declined the offers in my last quarter . 

Also it’s burden to take necessary approvals above the salary .
30/06/25, 13:41 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Also, we do ticketing 1 week before their joining by taking concert from the candidate if he is fine with signing on terms and conditions
30/06/25, 13:46 - Anjali Sathya TA Manager CADeploy Engineering: Here we get to know the interest level and also an acknowledgement from the candidates incase if don't join needs to be paid as per terms and conditions
30/06/25, 13:52 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hey everyone
Any new inputs on this one? It would be a great help.
30/06/25, 14:00 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Thanks.
30/06/25, 14:01 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: We are keeping everything on reimbursement basis so the organisation funds don’t get blocked
30/06/25, 14:11 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: We generally ask candidates to book it and  we reimburse the amount, below the capped amount.  
We did this to avoid declines and amounts lost in cancellations.
30/06/25, 14:32 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: aboslutely
30/06/25, 14:39 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: That’s good approach .
30/06/25, 14:54 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Relocation policy doesn't apply to international candidates though (relocating from UAE, Germany etc) and we make up for it in bonuses (because international moving costs are really high. a person moving to amazon luxembourg on avg gets covered upto 10L on movement expenses and we can't recoup that big amount on their return to india since they have return this) <This message was edited>

01/07/25, 12:54 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Hello Team,

A quick help from you all on this — as a startup, can the management decide what types of leaves they want to implement, or must it strictly adhere to the applicable state labour laws?

For example, if the organization provides only 12 days of Sick/Casual Leave (SL/CL) in a year, with no provision for Privilege/Earned Leave and no carry forward option, is that acceptable from a legal standpoint?

Would appreciate your inputs on how this works in practice, and whether flexibility is allowed based on company discretion and as an HR what needs to be put forward to management.
01/07/25, 12:54 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: .
01/07/25, 12:57 - Preeti Agrawal Sr. Manager HR Prozo: The minimum leaves as per the S&E act need to be given, over and above that is company's call.
01/07/25, 13:15 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: But not less right
01/07/25, 13:17 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: Yes, it can't be less
01/07/25, 13:18 - Preeti Agrawal Sr. Manager HR Prozo: Yes, pls.
01/07/25, 13:18 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: 5 Sick leave , 5 Causal Leave , 10 PL leaves . This is mandatory , over and above it’s subject to management call .
01/07/25, 13:20 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: But if management isn’t agreeing to this as an HR what steps needs to be taken
01/07/25, 13:41 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Management can’t disagree otherwise it’s an audit and compliance issue with the labor law
01/07/25, 13:41 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: And puts company at risk
01/07/25, 14:02 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Ok
01/07/25, 14:06 - Asmi Mittal Sr. Executive HR Ops Agrim: Hi, can anyone confirm how the intern to fulltime conversion usually happens at your organization?

Do you also practice the intern exit and then rejoining them as full time?
01/07/25, 14:13 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Yes they have to exit and next day oboarded as full time employee. There is no gap in between.
01/07/25, 14:14 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: You have to roll out a offer letter to them for full time employment
01/07/25, 14:14 - Muskan Pasrija TA Specialist OfBusiness: Yes, in our organization, if an intern completes their internship on 30th June, we treat that as their Last Working Day as an intern. If they are being converted to full-time, we carry out the onboarding formalities again from 1st July.

This approach is followed primarily in cases where the intern was initially hired only for the internship, and no pre-placement offer was extended at the beginning.

*For example*, when we hire interns specifically from campus, we issue a letter stating that they will work as interns for six months, after which their designation and package will be revised to a full-time role. In such cases, there is no exit or re-onboarding process involved - they continue seamlessly into the full-time position.
01/07/25, 14:21 - Asmi Mittal Sr. Executive HR Ops Agrim: Thank you for the clarity
01/07/25, 15:01 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: yes!! if intern completes his/her tenure as an intern we exit them as an intern and onboard them again freshly as a new employee.
01/07/25, 15:12 - Satyadipa Sarangi HR Manager Sid's Farm: Any leads on Tier 3 colleges in and around Bangalore and Hyderabad giving students for 3-6 months of internship?

03/07/25, 18:41 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Seems fair for both side travel. Stay would have been exceptional cases I suppose
03/07/25, 18:44 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: One way travel  is interesting though 😊 50% cost bearing by both parties
03/07/25, 18:45 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Train / flight booked basis seniority

08/07/25, 16:36 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Hello Team,

If an employee has received an offer letter prior to joining, but due to miscommunication, the offered CTC and designation did not align with what was discussed with the manager, and the employee was informed that the correction would be made post joining —
and later, after internal discussion, the CTC and designation were officially changed within the first week of joining —

👉 Can we issue an updated offer letter reflecting the revised CTC and designation, or is it not allowed once the initial offer has been issued?

please provide your inputs .
08/07/25, 16:46 - Fireside Dheeraj Nagar: Issue a new revised offer letter (clearly marked as "Revised Offer Letter" or "Updated Offer Letter") and Maintain a short email trail or HR note internally to explain why the revision was made — useful for audits or future HR reference. And at the end ask employee to sign the revised offer letter and share it with you.
08/07/25, 16:47 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: but my co-HR she is saying we cannot, we can provide some additional document that your Salary has been hiked and also there's a change in designation.
08/07/25, 16:47 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Many are providing both suggestions so confused which is correct
08/07/25, 16:48 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Bcoz employees need the updated offer letter
08/07/25, 16:49 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Generally no.  Alternatives are if employee records are updated that should suffice.  In case employee exits relieving letters and last salary slip do provide all req info <This message was edited>
08/07/25, 16:51 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: After joining again releasing offer letters as back dated would be system compliance issue.
08/07/25, 16:52 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: No it can be mentioned as revised offer right
08/07/25, 16:52 - Komal Patil HR Ops Specialist Companystore.io: Bcoz when researched on ChatGPT it said so <This message was edited>
08/07/25, 16:54 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Before joining you may hv fixed! After joining date it is not
08/07/25, 16:54 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Required
08/07/25, 16:54 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: This employee would hv deferred accepting offer letter
08/07/25, 16:55 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Or you should have made correction and given joining date, did joining formalities
08/07/25, 16:55 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Post joining all will be treated as correction only

18/07/25, 19:31 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Hi all, I’d appreciate your thoughts on this situation.

I have an employee in the night shift who has recently been taking frequent leaves citing medical issues. When she does report to work, she often signs off early and delegates her responsibilities to others, sometimes without my knowledge. This pattern has continued for the past two months.

While I’ve been accommodating so far, it’s starting to affect team productivity and morale. What’s more concerning is that 2-3 other employees have started following the same pattern after observing her behavior.

I’m considering offering her a 10-day medical leave to focus on her health and return with clarity. Alternatively, would it be fair to ask her to resign with a two-month notice period - one month being mandatory and the second flexible if she finds another opportunity?

I understand that asking someone to leave due to health concerns is sensitive and ethically tricky, but the indirect work-shifting and growing ripple effect on the team are now hampering operations.

Would love your input on how best to address this.
18/07/25, 19:33 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: Your idea of a 10-day paid medical leave is a great middle ground. It shows care and gives her space to recover, but also sets a timeline for clarity. Make it clear that she’s expected to return either fit to work or with further recommendations.
18/07/25, 19:34 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: If she returns but the pattern continues, document all instances and have a formal performance discussion. Let her know that unless there’s improvement, you may need to explore alternate arrangements, including a structured transition or even separation (in line with policy
18/07/25, 19:35 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Thanks Lijo!
18/07/25, 19:37 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: First you should have one on One with her, show empathy and understand things from her point of view.  Only thing that you should do right now is to keep things in writing.  See the outcome.  If she has personal issues with health then grant her 10 days leave as per policy coverage if you have one in place.  if she expresses difficulty in working in night shift check employment guidelines in offer letter mostly it will all be covered.  Then bring this matter to your management and keep HR informed.
18/07/25, 19:41 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: So far I have had informal chats, she generally has health concerns on Friday. I grant her 2-3 days leaves instead of 1 day, I have been accommodating but I guess things are taken for granted. You are right I should get more formal and start documenting things
18/07/25, 19:41 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: your meeting invite, agenda everything keep as evidence.  For any reason do not make decision without consulting your management/hr.
18/07/25, 19:43 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: yes documentation will help or incase of seperation, so many questions can be asked by employee including severance, please document it <This message was edited>
18/07/25, 19:45 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Yeah, its tricky.  I had one such case but following documented approach as a manager is important.  else you will pay for it :)
18/07/25, 19:46 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: Already paying 😃
18/07/25, 19:47 - Shrutkirti Nailwal HR: On a funnier note, pls check her Instagram and WhatsApp status if she hasn’t blocked you. If she puts status on the SM, she’s not sick at all 😜😁
18/07/25, 19:48 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: lol, off the records I know she is chilling.

Naukri is up for renewal and I got a quote 120-130% higher than the last for the same product <This message was edited>
29/07/25, 06:26 - Harika Velaga RR: Yep happens Neha but not sure 120% hike. They look at your usage report and quote.
29/07/25, 06:27 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah based on usage I hv retained the same product but they hv hiked up the price by 120%
29/07/25, 06:27 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Like what to negotiate there I don’t understand 
This is like a call towards don’t take Naukri
29/07/25, 06:28 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Monopoly ka pain
29/07/25, 06:28 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: What the hell is Naukri launcher 🤣
29/07/25, 06:29 - Harika Velaga RR: They know recruiters are highly dependent. But you should negotiate with them they will give you a lot of reasons but do dial it down a bit.
29/07/25, 06:29 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Haan I know 
But thoda toh sensible bane
29/07/25, 06:29 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Another stupid feature of theirs
29/07/25, 06:29 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: So for us also we had for a crazy rate but we got it down with shameless nego 
Slice dice action
29/07/25, 06:29 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Product folks trying to hard for no reason
29/07/25, 06:30 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yaar har saal Krishna inke saath Ganda negotiation hota hai
29/07/25, 06:30 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: But they hv never jacked up the price like this
29/07/25, 06:35 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: For us to be honest was not 120 %
It was like 50%
29/07/25, 06:35 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Try and ask for the logic but 120 is no math
29/07/25, 06:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Yeah
29/07/25, 06:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I wrote to them 1 liner 
No response
29/07/25, 06:38 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: I am
Howling it’s a mistake from them
29/07/25, 06:38 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: That’s also a new thing their sales folks don’t respond fast Aj Kal thoda chill vibes hai
29/07/25, 06:39 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: U faced this 
Arey Maine toh escalate kar diya 
Now I am talking to someone who is at a VP level
29/07/25, 06:58 - Rabi Agrawal Head HR Flobiz: They purposefully don't respond fast. They know that the closer it is to subscription end date, you more desperate we will become.
29/07/25, 06:59 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Yes once 
This time around the lady assigned to us was following up
29/07/25, 07:01 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: They also track your usage and number of open roles in pipeline...basis which they know how much dependent is your team on Naukri...u need to negotiate hard and bring it down as low as 20% to 30% or much lower if u can...but u will have tough time negotiating year on year... <This message was edited>
29/07/25, 07:07 - Sudhir Kumar B Aeries: They have been practicing this approach for more than 15 years...they try this type of negotiations with every company irrespective of size, only if you have very large account then they budge, else they play it hard year on year... <This message was edited>
29/07/25, 07:10 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: 120% se kitna slash karu
29/07/25, 07:10 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: This time they hv given me absurd pricing
29/07/25, 07:35 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: For Naukri, don't show need...Let it expire sometimes, we use to delay it by 2 weeks to 1 month approx , this we bargained for the same rates for 3 years.

Use need to strategies the sourcing before the expiry date, if it is super critical and high volume then this strategy won't work <This message was edited>
29/07/25, 08:36 - Vikas Sawant Sr. TA CommerceIQ: Is naukri portal still giving good relevant candidate,due to pricing and poor quality we had dropped them 2years back .
Are looking naukri for specific kind of hiring ?
29/07/25, 08:57 - Paul Thomas GM Salesken: You can bargain hard... Tell them you won't pay more than 75k a year for 2000cv views and 500 job post... They won't agree and you leave it... They will come back to you after a month and close it at maybe 80k
29/07/25, 10:03 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Naukri - office office ki kahani 🙄 <This message was edited>
29/07/25, 10:27 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: What are the portals working for you on non tech side
29/07/25, 10:48 - Vikas Sawant Sr. TA CommerceIQ: Instahyre and sometimes LinkedIn
29/07/25, 10:51 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Ok thanks
29/07/25, 11:27 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: Instahyre works well for tech
29/07/25, 11:27 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: They also have non tech, but isn't very strong basis our usage.
29/07/25, 11:28 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Whatever is said and done. None of the portals has been able to completely replace Naukri. There is a dependency on Naukri for sure.
29/07/25, 11:30 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: For volume non tech, you can try apna jobs and for other monster has recently revamped its database and claim have almost equal database to that of naukri and have validated by calling candidates themselves. Not sure how true but you may want to explore.
29/07/25, 11:31 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: Agree, and hence the monopoly.
29/07/25, 11:32 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Regarding their pricing. Few tips that I follow and have found success most of the time. 
1. Make sure your renewal is in the month of March every year, so they will negotiate more
2. I do not renew immediately. I let go for a month after the renewal date and then the CS team calls to negotiate. When they come back we have better chances on negotiating
29/07/25, 13:44 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: Asking for a friend (a product company founder), does anyone know of a brand image consultant in Bengaluru?
29/07/25, 14:00 - Divya Chethan Founder CBREX: Sonia Pardesi Image Consultant.vcf (file attached)
29/07/25, 14:00 - Divya Chethan Founder CBREX: You can probably try reaching out to Sonia
29/07/25, 14:03 - Naveen Chaudhary Founder list{a}: We used to face the same music on every renewal , hiked prices by 100% without any rational explanation. It took us  2 years to go completely off Naukri. My team primarily uses Linkedin / Getlista / Clay /Lusha etc. It's a change of mindset and will take time.
29/07/25, 14:07 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: While Naukri continues to offer one of the most comprehensive talent databases, many candidates still prefer updating their profiles both on LinkedIn and Naukri, ensuring maximum visibility across platforms.
29/07/25, 14:09 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: this has always worked for me in last 3 years:):) please try this they have targets to close by month end so they will come back to you. just tell them we dint get approval  from management for this cost
29/07/25, 14:12 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: Here’s how it typically works, Neha , as the company grows, Naukri gradually raises the price of the same product, claiming it’s due to increased demand. They’ll often say, ‘This is the best price we can offer your organization right now.’ But don’t worry, I’ve personally renewed a 16L product for just 7L + taxes, with additional logins included, same as last year. Just wait until your subscription is about to expire. By month-end, they’ll likely come back with a much better offer 🙂
29/07/25, 14:14 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: Exactly!
29/07/25, 14:14 - Jayant Joshi Lead TA Opentext: Who has patience, wins !
29/07/25, 14:15 - Lijo Varghese TA Manager HealthifyMe: yes and I bet my Team, just wait for month end, we will save lot of cost, I recieved the mail with better pricing and the answer was its the month end discount only for your org:):):)

04/08/25, 16:04 - Reena P Sr. HR 56 Secure: Asking for a friend, can anyone share contacts of recruitment agencies for hiring Junior Design Architects? TIA
04/08/25, 16:18 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: Hi Everyone,

Quick check—does anyone have a rough idea about LinkedIn Recruiter pricing?
We're planning to take a license and would love to get some ballpark understanding before setting up a meeting with their team.

Thanks in advance!
04/08/25, 16:31 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 40L for 10 licenses before we took it to enterprise which is upwards of 1 crore. Suffice to say they're vultures far beyond Naukri ever will be 😂
04/08/25, 16:40 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: But enterprise has unlimited everything - job postings, licences etc. Plus YoY appreciation on cost is 5-9% & not 50%
04/08/25, 16:42 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: I’m looking for the SPOC at Naukri!

Planning to take a new subscription.

Any leads? Also, any advice before getting into negotiations?;)
04/08/25, 16:43 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yeah - try & avoid taking a subscription 🤣
04/08/25, 16:43 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: <Media omitted>

04/08/25, 16:49 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: Haha. I would still need that subscription 😂.
04/08/25, 16:50 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: Thank you.
04/08/25, 16:52 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Hmm. Hehe
04/08/25, 16:54 - Priyanka Poonia Asst. Manager TA Grizmo Labs: any advice before getting into negotiations here as well please
along with any reference - if possible
04/08/25, 16:54 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: if you get the budget approved for enterprise, should get 1 non-geofenced license as well - really helps in finding that global talent you need.
04/08/25, 16:56 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: As far as what I have seen, Linkedin barely budges unless it's enterprise clients but hoping for more helpful answer from others here
04/08/25, 16:59 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I had used Edify brokers and Plum. During this process I had seen Nova,Loop, pazzcare too. Plum went through a lot of churn, their digital platform is good but personally my experience was not great. Can share from Edify., pls talk and figure out <This message was edited>
04/08/25, 17:00 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: We had that. Over 3 years, the cost per year went from 90 lakhs to 99 lakhs. 

The value however was over 25x of the cost..
04/08/25, 17:02 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Their prices come from the central team so hardly any scope for neg. But they also don't overcharge. You can build a level of predictability & budget costs accordingly

07/08/25, 12:35 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Yes, Please use the same template you use for other roles,  add these pointers whichever is necessary
07/08/25, 12:36 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: So that the offer letter remains the same for all the employees
07/08/25, 14:25 - Anupama Murthy Founder AVS Technology & Talent Consulting: Got it. Sorted with the rest of the clause but wanted to be legally right with non complete & confidentiality clause. Any tips here?

07/08/25, 14:56 - Anupama Murthy Founder AVS Technology & Talent Consulting: All employees will sign and NDA after joining. It’s still a small team
07/08/25, 15:00 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Hi All
We are facing a challenge in hiring good product designers with B2C experience (Web & App).

Any suggestions where to find good ones who can join at the earliest??
07/08/25, 15:17 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Lot of them are actually very active on X. Identify a design leader there with good reach and ask them to share a post - they'll do so only if your product has good design philosophy/foundation behind it or product is compelling itself (and design is lacking). You'll get the ones hiding in pockets be interested in your role - you have to love bomb them here because if you don't take care of them here (whether a fit or not), the others will just never come to you again (good designers have a small community and word travels very fast)

traditional method is to explore portfolios around an idea via dribble, indiefolio, etc. these are usually curated by the platform, and then message them on LI.

old method is to post job for them in such platforms, which works but good designers don't have time to see roles on those sites - they see them on LI
07/08/25, 15:21 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: We discussed the process earlier here :)

A quick question, do companies give out goodies (like T-shirts & jackets) to their in-house call centre team? If yes, is the quality the same as the core team?
I am talking for 250+ call centre agents here.
20/08/25, 15:09 - Rohit Vatsyayan TA Head SwiffyLabs: From what I have seen
Basics yes,hoodies and tshirts yes(helps in brending/ATL) 
Some function specific goodies are done from time to time

22/08/25, 13:30 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: we had this in my earlier org. Monthly 8K towards Gym, Intrenet and magazine subscription
22/08/25, 14:54 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: insurance coverage is quite good! usually companies have 5-7L only. Gym of 18k is quite nice too. Boeing provides 50k for this as the outlier example I know of.

26/08/25, 13:35 - Anurag Tiwari TA Head Deutsche Telekom: My hiring challenge is that I need strong candidates from product-based companies, but our compensation benchmark is below P50. This means we have to put in significant effort to identify top talent who are currently on relatively lower salaries.

I also believe that in leadership hiring, AI has limited impact. I’m not sure what exact product he is building, and while I look forward to seeing it, I still have my doubts. That said, I do feel AI could disrupt more generic recruiting—such as vanilla or bulk hiring—where the process is more repetitive and transactional.
26/08/25, 13:35 - Anurag Tiwari TA Head Deutsche Telekom: Feel nahi aaya- hahaha
26/08/25, 13:40 - Mahantesh Goudar HR Manager Uni Cards: It is "Comet".  integrates with applications like Gmail, LinkedIn, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets to execute complex workflows. 

eg, it can identify potential candidates based on specific criteria, compile their information, and send personalized outreach emails. plus it can manage email follow-ups, update excel, and coordinate meeting schedules.

We are looking to launch a internal referral program for our company. Majority of the role that are open on a recurring basis are non tech roles such as Sales and BD.

I'd appreciate any suggestions on what I need to have in a referral policy and what should the benifits we need to provide to someone who reffers a candidate and they get selectedm
26/08/25, 17:33 - Roopa Puranikmath Sr. Lead Kyndryl: Few I can think of 1) Payout timeline 2) Reference bonus applies to post joining only Not offer roll out/selection 3) You should have some math on what the referral amount is. Gen. fresher referrals do not work for payouts. Position Band, Salary range can be equated to arrive at what can be referral bonus. 3) Who is eligible to refer. (Exclude who are under investigation, exit pipeline) 5) You may want to think of unlimited referrals / cap on x no of referrals per employee.  6) For calculation only basic salary range will apply 7) Are referrals bonus payout taxable (get view from payroll team) in reality its yes 8) When will referral bonus payout gets credited; immediately post joining or in the salary cycle. But you should have solution sorted for a possible situation of, if joiner quits before bonus payout!  Trust this helps, let me know.

Wassup? I needed some help. We are right now trending on no 7 on https://tatechscape.com/top-50/. This is a global list of the your loved products. The deadline is 31st Aug. 

If you have used InterviewVector, and you love us, do rate our product 10/10 on this, that will help us put our product in the list of top TA products out there.

In case you think that you would rate us 9 or 8 on scale of 10, share the feedback and we will work on making the product better. But still please rate us 10/10 only since every other company is doing this in the list (which is making this a rigged competition like G2 😅)

Thanks for the help!

01/09/25, 14:58 - Jnanakshi Tambe HR Manager GetSetResumes: Hello,
I need some clarity on a situation. An employee was terminated, but now her termination has been revoked. In this case, should we issue a new offer letter, or is it sufficient to revoke the termination through the same email where termination was communicated? If anyone has handled a similar case, please share your inputs.
01/09/25, 14:59 - Krishna Vyas Carnot Lead HR: Termination is always with immediate effect 
If that’s the case then everything has to be done from the start
01/09/25, 15:08 - Jnanakshi Tambe HR Manager GetSetResumes: was placed on notice period, but her employment has since been extended. She has continued working without any break in service.
In this case, is it necessary to issue a new offer letter, or would it be sufficient to formally confirm the extension of her employment via email?
01/09/25, 15:09 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Then she wasn't terminated but asked to leave with notice, and then that decision is taken back. correct?
01/09/25, 15:12 - Jnanakshi Tambe HR Manager GetSetResumes: Yes correct
01/09/25, 15:12 - Stuti John Paul HR Specialist Recro: Depends on the LWD...if it's in the same month, you can just simply continue via dropping an extension mail, as the payroll won't be hampered
01/09/25, 15:14 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: then nothing is to be done. just revoke the separation flow on your HRMS and continue normally if she was FTE. If she was contractual, then you should revisit terms and length of the agreement.
01/09/25, 15:15 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: there should be a special note to payroll if the flow revoking is done after their monthly cutoff from the database they refer for their activity. <This message was edited>

01/09/25, 21:48 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Help needed on scenario here: there’s a CXO who has joined a team where multiple other leaders have already proven and established themselves. New CXO is hiring few folks (more junior to the aforementioned leaders) but his judgement is dissimilar from the group. These leaders took interviews of these folks but don’t find them good enough for the team at the proposed level. These leaders don’t want to ruin their relationship with the CXO either (CXO is not their manager). how do you advise your leader stakeholder in sharing this feedback candidly without offending yet making the right decision together (nothing can be written)
01/09/25, 21:49 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Detail: The interviewed folks were referred by the CXO ^
01/09/25, 21:54 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: - Are these junior folks for the same CXO's team or other? 
- What I've seen work in my case is candidly sharing examples of how people with certain traits similar to these referred folks, multiple times did not work well for the team's performance density and culture in the past.

If the leader is mature enough, they'll understand if this is shared with the right intent and demeanor.
01/09/25, 21:57 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: I think there cannot be a blanket answer to this. The stakeholders and CXO should have a one-on-one for each candidate or all candidates together and the stakeholder/s should put across why they think these folk’s won’t be a good fit. The CXO might have solid reasoning for referring some of these candidates. Basically, a rational and candid conversation between two hightly experienced folks
02/09/25, 03:06 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Thank you for these points. Main challenge is, while your intent is right - the CXO would feel not supported at the outset. CXO and similar level folks bulldoze through challenges to get results and it breaks real dynamics when your own teammates/leaders who you wanted to count on, don’t and CREATE blockers. Top is especially political as is and it frays relationships really badly, often beyond repair and actual trust. My stakeholders are struggling exactly with this.
02/09/25, 03:07 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: It’s a hard pill to communicate either way, just have to be respectful. Debrief is the worst place to do this because you end up embarrassing the new person in front of other leaders that their judgement is not good enough yet for this team. It’s a challenge even in 1-1, but there’s no coming back from a damning debrief. <This message was edited>

Also, can anyone help me know if they do separate Tshirts for call center teams in their company?
03/09/25, 15:03 - Paul Thomas GM Salesken: 
03/09/25, 15:19 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: its decided on the fabric and volumes factored for  the pricing
03/09/25, 15:24 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: +1 to Aparna’s response. It will depend upon the units and quality of fabric. It can range anywhere from 300-1200
03/09/25, 16:08 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: I understand, but I wanted to know what is most common. Like, do companies do branded or unbranded T-shirts, and is the quality separate for different sets of teams (eg, call centre team)?
03/09/25, 16:26 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: We don't have a call centre team at our company but in general the quality is always the same for all.

I would go one step back and objectify/codify what they need to see from the role and what they are okay letting pass. Often its just top 1 or 2 traits that need to be aligned which are differentiator. Rest is fine and ownes by hiring manager.

Need some quick advice. We rolled out an offer recently, but there are some major red flags from the candidate’s side post-offer, and we’re thinking of withdrawing it.

Can this be done, and if yes, what’s the best way to handle it without creating a negative impact?

As of yesterday, the candidate hadn’t resigned (though they said they might). If they actually have resigned, what are our options in that case?

Would really appreciate your inputs.

09/09/25, 12:41 - Arun Kumar D Sr. Lead TA Contentstack: First things first, start building a fresh pipeline. On the offered candidate, I had faced a similar situation a few weeks back. I tried engaging with the candidate in detail to understand his true intent — pushed for in-person meetups, resignation email, residential address for couriering gifts, and BGV checks. Eventually, he gave up and officially declined the offer, luckily a month before his joining date. In this case, we can’t push the candidate until they officially decline after securing another offer, so it may take some time.

OPTION: 25% and more (1 vote)

11/09/25, 09:40 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: the reason i am asking this is because i gave more than 25%  and still folks are saying that we are underpaid and market me i am the baniya 🥲
11/09/25, 09:41 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: so wanted to understand the matket avg
11/09/25, 09:57 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Appraisal hikes just about 10% being mean avg and hiring hikes toh kuch bhi hain 😅 100% bhi hain, hence your folks are just comparing peer market rates without understanding company stage. Don’t give market rate, try to give closer to it as per your company stage. Market rate is defined by scaled, established setups not early-mid stage startups
11/09/25, 09:58 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I know you already know this, yeh bas reminder hain 🤓 <This message was edited>

11/09/25, 10:21 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: minor correction - our avg is 38% appraisal 🙈
11/09/25, 10:23 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: and we are hiring awesome sdr’s. so please send good folks because we give crazy hikes 🤣🤣
11/09/25, 10:31 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: Sachin, you should hire me 🙋🏽‍♀️
11/09/25, 10:33 - Fireside Shiffana MK: I strictly follow compa ratio. So, hike % is different for diff and is based on both parity and performance. We keep industry benchmarking as mid point on compa scale
11/09/25, 10:35 - Fireside Shiffana MK: I feel you!
11/09/25, 10:35 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: Used to follow this to the t.
Parity, Performance + I add Potential too.
11/09/25, 10:36 - Fireside Shiffana MK: All things potential, I have moved to variable/incentive format - so that it inspires people, get right folks rewarded, and not have risk for business/finance. 

Coz i really dont trust our judgement on "potential"
11/09/25, 10:37 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: just fyi - i didnt count variable as part of hike %
11/09/25, 10:44 - Fireside Shiffana MK: what's the comp bracket here? will refer folks accordingly
11/09/25, 10:44 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Ab now this is just show off 😁🤣
11/09/25, 10:44 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: Potential contributes a lot to identify successor, promotion, additional responsibilities etc. Most of them will be (already) doing some delta (more than the role requires). Weightage was given to that.
Depends on the performance philosopy and the Compensation philosopy of an organization
11/09/25, 10:49 - Sachin Mittal InterviewVector: arre that was my sales pitch 😆
11/09/25, 10:49 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: In such cases I go back to the folks asking about their source. In most cases the “market” reference here is that one friend they have who works at an Amazon or an Uber and ofcourse makes more than others.
11/09/25, 11:00 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Do you have a job with 25% hike?

18/09/25, 19:06 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: People, need a bit of help. 

We want to relook at the leave policies in our org. 

We currently have 18 vacation days (PL), 12 days combined SL and CL. I’m curious to know what leave policies at your org look like. 

People with unlimited leave policies - I’m jealous already. 

For reference, I work at a travel tech - Omio, HQ in Berlin, and building teams in India. 

Ping me or @⁨Aishwarya Tiwari HR Ops Advisor Omio⁩ with the details please.
18/09/25, 19:15 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Companies with unlimited leave actually have employees taking lesser leave than those with limited leave. So actually you are blessed 😀
18/09/25, 19:20 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: I agree, I have been on both sides to be honest, and I prefer the unlimited piece.
18/09/25, 19:21 - Sapna Upadhyay Sr. Recruiter Microsoft: I think it is debatable we have 25 leaves paid leaves apart from other leaves and we are asked to use them.
18/09/25, 19:22 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Haha, same here. We implemented this at Kronos in 2016. But alas, employees actually took lesser leaves
18/09/25, 19:23 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yeah, so you have paid leave which you are being asked to utilize. Unlimited leave, means there is no paid leave at all.
18/09/25, 19:23 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: It's the same with learning budgets. You give everyone a value, but only 10% actually utilize the same
18/09/25, 19:23 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: I'm not debating here.. I'm sharing a perspective
18/09/25, 19:24 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: There is no actual right or wrong here. Each has advantages & disadvantages
18/09/25, 19:27 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: We have 18 Paid leaves, 12 Sick leaves and 12 holidays in a calendar year
18/09/25, 19:28 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: The reason for companies to opt for unlimited leaves is to avoid the leave carrying forward and leave encashment which is mandatory <This message was edited>
18/09/25, 19:28 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: Agreed. Simply a matter of preference and perspective.
18/09/25, 19:30 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: This saves a lot of calculations time and when many companies are working remote it is tough to track
18/09/25, 19:31 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Also tracking leaves is a big pain
18/09/25, 19:32 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: When we did this at Kronos is 2016 though, it wasn't for the financial reasons. It was for the experience. It had great feedback but we realized there were only pockets of employees that actually leveraged this benefit
18/09/25, 19:33 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: I know buddy, but the labour inspectors have started recommending this option
18/09/25, 19:33 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: As it avoids lot of effort
18/09/25, 19:34 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: Leaves carrying forward and leave encashment is a big pain man
18/09/25, 19:34 - GV Sridharan Director TA & Ops Astuto: If you don't have a proper system in place
18/09/25, 19:37 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: Yes, that's post 2022 or something like that.. Today many are implementing the same
18/09/25, 19:38 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: But I was just reminiscing the good old days :-)
18/09/25, 19:41 - Sampath Arni Ravi HR TBC1: Freedom of leaves kills harmony  of the work .
18/09/25, 20:09 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: What is the topic from Sid
18/09/25, 20:09 - Suyash Kumar: I'll share that soon
18/09/25, 20:10 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: HRMS simplifies
18/09/25, 20:18 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: we wanted to implement open leave policies few years back and did some research. It only said, people cant take whats not there in basket and also from compliance point of view for leave encashment / EL , it is better to have standard policy. If there is no cash flow constraints, we can add all types of paid leaves! <This message was edited>
18/09/25, 20:20 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Just wanted to know are if  you guys putting any limit on WFH or it is open? how are you handling this ? Does this exist along with Hybrid working mode too? Is it done on role wise or something else?
18/09/25, 20:25 - Aparna Srikanth Director Global HR Merkle Science: We have a capping on WFH as it's meant to cover for exigencies
18/09/25, 20:27 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: whats the limit?
18/09/25, 20:27 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: are you on hybrid or WFO?
18/09/25, 20:35 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: 4 days in office.
18/09/25, 20:38 - Fireside Shiffana MK: And an author,  kind person, and many more :)
18/09/25, 20:40 - Fireside Shiffana MK: There is a mandated structure bases on companies act for each state. Thats basic, and one  can be more leniant, but cant do anything lessee
19/09/25, 08:51 - You pinned a message
19/09/25, 12:32 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: Quick question — what’s the law around unlimited leave policies? Do companies with such policies allow encashment of leaves? If not isn't it non compliant ?
19/09/25, 12:36 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: - Encashment is not mandatory. 
- Law doesn't speak for unlimited leaves. Its only a matter of audits that some day if there is an audit and the labour department observes that your folks have not been allowed to take off days atleast the minimum that's said by the law, then there will be a problem. Startups usually don't face such strong checks.

As far as the company is not restricting employees from taking the minimum applicable time off, all is ok. <This message was edited>
19/09/25, 12:45 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: Not as per our compliance advisor, earned leaves have to be encashed.

Earned Leave (EL) / Privilege Leave (PL)
Employees in Karnataka are entitled to 15 days of Earned Leave per year, with an annual leave carry forward limit recently increased from 30 days to 45 days under the Shops & Commercial Establishments Act. This leave accrues at the rate of one day for every 20 days worked, allowing for a steady accumulation throughout the year. Employees can carry forward up to 45 days of unused Earned Leave, providing flexibility for future use. At the end of employment, any unused Earned Leave is encashable, ensuring employees don’t lose the benefit of their accrued time off.
19/09/25, 12:46 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: Not if you don't have earned leaves 😅
19/09/25, 12:50 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: This is more of relevance in cases where there is a formal leave policy, because then you also deduct pay when anyone has consumed the leaves. 
In an unlimited format, you're deducting the pay is not a part of any situation, so the company can get away with not giving earned leaves.
19/09/25, 12:53 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: Our advisor advised that we have to provide the earned/privileged leaves, as these are mandatory😀. We had to revise our leaves to 18 EL per year.
But it is not fun tracking attendance when people just don't apply leaves on the tool😔
19/09/25, 12:56 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: If a company has an unlimited leave policy and no earned leave (EL), they will still have to pay up to 45 days of leave encashment if an employee raises a legal issue.
19/09/25, 12:56 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: Yeah, that's true :)
19/09/25, 12:58 - Shivani Pande Sr. Manager People Success Rocketium: But, if these are tracked and the employee has taken leaves more than the entitled ELs, then the company can also show that they've consumed these many.
19/09/25, 13:01 - Shivaraju K P TA Manager OppDoor: Yep, there are multiple registers we will have to maintain as well to track them.

We have been asked to maintain 
Shops and Establishments Act Form F- Register of Leave with Wage
Shops and Establishments Act Form H- Leave with wage book
19/09/25, 13:39 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: Maybe my message here did not land correctly, so clarifying again. 

What do the leave policies at your org look like? Can you share specific info so I can present comparative data for my management?
19/09/25, 13:52 - Shiv Jha Associate Director TA Zolo: •	36 Privilege Leaves (PL)
	•	10 National Holidays (to be availed flexibly as per the published holiday list)
	•	3 Mandatory Holidays
19/09/25, 13:58 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Yup. Our compliance advisor suggested the same.

In couple of labour audits that I faced asked us to implement clear carry forward/encashment policies <This message was edited>
19/09/25, 13:59 - Asha S K Sr. HR Administrator Unient: 15 Privilege Leaves 
10 Sick Leaves 
10 National Holidays

1. What is the sales hiring process for Account Executive (AEs), Sr. AEs and Director/Sr Director (Sales) roles at your organisation in India?
2. What are your sourcing channels for the profiles?
3. ⁠How many rounds and what all do you cover generally?
4. ⁠Any learnings you'd like to share on Sales hiring?

Would appreciate if you can share your insights!

09/10/25, 21:27 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: 1.The junior levels are generally bulk hiring and can be done inhouse or through third party depending on the volume. Most of these positions are closed via hiring events. 
For leadership hiring its best through LinkedIn.
09/10/25, 21:41 - Bhavya Arora TTD: Thank you, Anu!
09/10/25, 21:41 - Bhavya Arora TTD: Anyone else in B2B saas who might have some learnings to share?
09/10/25, 21:49 - Guntaas Lotay Sr. Recruiter Headout: Hi! We’ve not hired AEs in India but I’ll give you a breakdown of what we follow for RoW:

1. For the sales process, broad strokes of what’s evaluated in these rounds:
- Past performance: what kind of quota/KPIs did they carry? How familiar are they with their funnel conversions? Comfort with CRM and other dashboarding tools. Examples of difficult deals they’ve worked on are discussed and our team has a bit of sales role play to identify how they do discovery, overcome objections, etc.
2. ⁠In terms of sourcing channels, LinkedIn has worked best (both inbound through job postings and outreach that we do). Response rates for outreach typically range between 30-45% depending on geography. We’ve also tried out some country specific job boards too.
3. ⁠Generally 3 discussion rounds (recruiter < case study < reporting manager < leadership)

In terms of learnings, we’ve seen that at least in the context of Headout, folks who have tackled problem statements outside of just pure sales tend to be better fits. <This message was edited>

Thanks in advance 
Sunit
11/10/25, 16:15 - Suyash Kumar: Folks, any insights here?
11/10/25, 16:19 - Ajith KP Director Talent Stellaris: It depends on the reason behind the candidate leaving the organisation. If it is due to org restrucutre and mishire, then it's on the firm to own up. If it is due to candidate changing their mind and joining another firm, then a replacement is mandated. If the invoice is not processed, then this can be held against the consultant till a replacement is found.
Typically, replacement should be provided by the consultant within a reasonable period of 30-60 days.

11/10/25, 21:17 - Clive Rodrigues HR Livspace: @⁨Sunit Desai Sr. Manager People Experience CashFlo⁩ - I'm guessing your vendor contract would already be signed & this would already be enforceable. Happy to share specific insights or guidance, if required
11/10/25, 22:45 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: I’m actively hiring for these exact roles at a B2B SaaS startup myself.
11/10/25, 23:09 - Sivakanth Pappu TA Specialist Lifesight: Ideal Background:
	•	Tier 1 or Tier 2 college background or strong startup experience (B2B or B2C)
	•	Demonstrated career growth. e.g., promotions, awards, or performance recognition

Evaluation Criteria (Current & Past Experience)
	1.	Targets: What revenue or quota targets do they carry?
	2.	Ownership: Are these individual (IC) or team targets?
	3.	Attainment - What percentage of target achievement have they demonstrated?
	•	Cross-verify with deal size to ensure consistency (many AEs get filtered out here as the numbers often don’t align).
	4.	Can they design or tailor solutions to client needs? (Key criterion for us)
	5.	Do they independently close deals?
       6.  Double down on evaluating any short stints in their past experience

Candidate Sourcing Channels
	•	100% Outbound: LinkedIn & LinkedIn Recruiter Lite

Interview Process
	1.	TA Intro Call (15–20 mins) – Initial screening and interest check
	2.	Round 1: Co-founder discussion
	3.	Round 2: Take-home assignment – Candidate to research the product and prepare a product pitch
	•	This is where most AEs are filtered out, as it tests their product understanding, articulation, and solutioning capability.
	4.	Round 3 (Final): CEO interview

- Many valuable and unique learnings, too detailed to cover here

28/10/25, 20:04 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: This is for which locations ? Bangalore specifically?
28/10/25, 20:04 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Yes, all are in Bangalore. Only ops folks would be locally based in other cities.
28/10/25, 20:18 - Shreyanka Trivedi Head Of People Squadstack: @⁨Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared⁩ pass TA connects , also if analytics folks
28/10/25, 20:30 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Just curious, why is zepto laying off after securing funding?
28/10/25, 20:31 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: We have hiring for Growth role. Please share the list once you receive it.
28/10/25, 20:38 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: 4 TA leads were let go today, I’ll DM you their contact.

28/10/25, 20:41 - Hemlata Kapri Head Oneshot: @⁨Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared⁩ you can share me references for TA as i am also hiring for one of my client <This message was edited>
28/10/25, 20:43 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Hi Purvi, it’s a tactic many founders have to employ during fundraise to ensure company’s runway and survival. It usually exposes company’s real metrics not being so rosy as projected and founder has to ensure cost optimisation and cuts post raise.
28/10/25, 20:44 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: DMing you
28/10/25, 20:46 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I’ll share once I get the full list. But full retention (CLM + CRM) org will be asked to put down papers this week as their marketing budget is reduced to 0 since beginning of Oct <This message was edited>
28/10/25, 20:47 - Abhipsa Khuntia TA Lead CynLr: Damn!! That's rough

Thought zepto was doing well and just got pre ipo funding
28/10/25, 22:30 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: Whats the tech stack?
28/10/25, 22:31 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We are seeing this trend now a days. Layoffs after receiving funding or IPO.
28/10/25, 22:36 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: But all said and done zepto payscale will be higher and not every company can match it and employees will wait for sometime before they pick next role for multiole reasons, got esop liquidity or good severance package etc etc .... real world challenges. <This message was edited>
28/10/25, 23:11 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: I agree, but after hearing Amazon’s news today I think they’d have more urgency. Zepto engineers are paid really well. Tech leads with 6-9 yrs are 50+ mostly

29/10/25, 12:20 - Shreya HR BlockTheory: Hey Folks, looking for your feedback on *Healthysure and Pazcare* — which one do you think is better in terms of benefits, turnaround time (TAT), and overall experience?
29/10/25, 12:24 - Prapti Talent Lead Setu: Go for Plum, lol. 

We did not finalise Pazcare, but interactions with the team were pleasant overall. <This message was edited>
29/10/25, 12:32 - Shreya HR BlockTheory: hmm, one of the criteria is also vendor who has US affiliates. 
So plum had better benefits than pazcare in your case or was it the overall cost?

30/10/25, 11:46 - Shraddha Agrawal HR Manager ClearFeed: Not sure about zoho, but I had a similar issue with keka ATS.

I need one suggestion. 

We are a Series A fintech startup, and planning to hire our first HRBP. I wanted to understand the interview process that we can follow given that we don't have an HR head or so to evaluate the candidates.

Any suggestions or guidance on this would be really helpful.

TIA!!
03/11/25, 10:48 - Gargi Rajan Associate Director HR Unicommerce: Apart from the regular interviews - TA screening , founders, stakeholders,  i would suggest to get one round done by a  HR head (from Startups) from anyone in the network of the founders
03/11/25, 10:57 - Mitali Jain CEO Scalent Solutions: You can also ask the candidate to create a roadmap for the next 6 months/1 year and present it to the Founder/s. Generally, the first HRBP ends up doing a lot of operations tasks as well so there should be alignment with the candidate on that front.

Which colleges are you targeting in Bangalore and Chennai? <This message was edited>
04/11/25, 12:32 - Dhriti Mahajan Talent kipi.bi: Hey, for hiring our first HRBP, I suggest a 3-step interview process.
Round 1:  C Suite round - CEO or functional leadership- discussion to assess business alignment, ownership mindset, and how they think about scaling people strategy in a fast-growing setup - strategic PMS, culture evangelism, roadmap to expand and support BUs.
Round 2: Functional or case-based round to test execution skills/ assessment followed by a C Suite interaction to discuss the assessment details—e.g., how they’d build HR systems, performance frameworks, and culture as we scale from 50–200 employees. KRA mapping, OD interventions.
Round 3: Culture and stakeholder-fit discussion to gauge communication, influence, and ability to partner with business teams, BU Heads, engaging strategic ESAT etc.
Optionally, we can involve an external HR advisor for one round to validate depth on compliance, PMS, and process design. This structure gives us a fair balance of strategy, execution, and culture evaluation
04/11/25, 12:33 - Shivani Goyal TA Associate: Thanks!

Any feedback on LinkedIn hiring assistant feature ?
06/11/25, 06:18 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Guys I wanted to ask a very basic question , do you calculate recruiters productivity on number of offers per month or joiners ? Esp for tech recruiters ? Considering the market trend of offer drop outs ?
06/11/25, 06:58 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: I do relevant CVs sourced, interviews cordinated and no of offers for recruiters. No of joiners, process improvements, stake holder management for the recruitment lead / manager.
06/11/25, 07:00 - Kavitha Kalaiselvi Director Talentegrity Consulting: Folks, pls refer a BGV company that could do basic BGV and send a report. This is for a company in Chennai.
06/11/25, 07:01 - Manisha HR Motorq: Spring verify
KPMG team does too
06/11/25, 07:30 - Harika Velaga RR: Spring verify
06/11/25, 07:44 - Sukant Saxena Sr. Lead TA Leadsquared: Offers per month is straightforward. Throughput quality helps you judge and actually help them become more efficient. Throughput ratio in HM ratio selection and interviews shows closer partnership and hence higher efficiency/productivity and also diagnosing HM zigzagging early
06/11/25, 07:48 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: Thanks Sukant
06/11/25, 07:49 - Neha Lakhwani Capillary: My reason of asking this is whether we should hv a metric based on offers or joiners for recruiters 
Conversions I understand talk about quality of profiles
06/11/25, 07:53 - Anupriya Krishnan Director TA: Ideally, just the offers, because conversions are always ambiguous.  There are companies who evaluate basis joiners, but in such places scope and planning is done much in advance.

One of the post’s comments also diagnosed another issue correctly - that people/HR function was meant to empower business as a rotating function - whatever business needed, that part of HR roulette wheel came and helped. Instead, roulette wheel is fighting within itself. Even us TA folks blame HRBP when they don’t control hiring, and HRBP vice versa in terms of breaking budget lines etc instead of educating business together the right way to go about their team expansion. Partnership often gets lost in favour of optics <This message was edited>

14/11/25, 11:42 - Purvika Dasa Trainee TA Zyoin: Hi everyone, I need help with a PF query.

In the new ECR v3, there doesn’t seem to be a clear option to file PF returns for employees who were missed in the original monthly filing. The available options are Regular, Revised, and Supplementary, but none of them directly match this situation.

Has anyone handled a missed employee case in ECR v3 and can guide on the correct way to file it?

Quick question — we’re looking to understand the insurance coverage typically offered by Series A startups (we’re a fintech startup based in Bangalore).

Could you please help with the following:

- What types of insurance are usually covered? (Medical / Accidental / Life)
- Who is generally included in the coverage? (Only employee / Employee + Parents / Employee + up to 5 dependents)
- What is the usual coverage amount for each of these plans?

Thanks in advance!

14/11/25, 21:23 - Chandra Prabha HR Eines Healthcare: 
14/11/25, 22:14 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: I am using it.
14/11/25, 22:22 - Shraddha Agrawal HR Manager ClearFeed: - consider medical GMC (minimum ) and accidental (based on budget) to start with. 
- ⁠Employe, spouse and kids (minimum) 
- ⁠Parents insurance will require higher head count, if you at below 50 employees many insurers will not consider 
- ⁠between 5L - 10L Sum Insured is good to start with 

Also look at the demographics of your employees in what age group they are, if people are say 30-35 years above they would ideally expect parents, spouse, kids insurance and good sum insured. 

The more head count you have better per life premium you can negotiate.
14/11/25, 22:33 - Kumuda Rao Co-founder Stochast: We were not series A in my past company and now also not but this is what I had designed:

Company 1 : 5L GMC, parents included for those employees who wanted so optional, else its spouse+ kids. GPA : 15L.
Parents premium were on employees. 

Company B : 10L GMC, 5L GPA, self + spouse+ kids + Parents coverage <This message was edited>

If employees want top up, you can check for that too.

Coverage
