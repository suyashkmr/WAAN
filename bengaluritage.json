The fairer sex wore pastel shades, with elegant ethnic and geometric patterns and understated jewellery, the men adorned rather garish, dazzling, scintillating, irridescent, sequined kurtas of varying length and material, from see-through crocheted to heavily ornate shades of royal blue, blood red, magenta and even shocking pink.\nOther than this glaring reversal, what was on display?\nThe show of hands, that went up in the air as purohits chanted the mantras, not with devotion, but to click the photographs at the right moment.\nTradition isn't what it used to be, or may be it is. \nWho cares!\nEnjoy the festival!!!",
