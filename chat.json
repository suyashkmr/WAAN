During day time, I am either cribbing about how can we hire good sales and customer success folks. During the nights, I am either found at good gol gappa stands or performing standup comedy in front of my friends. Sorry guys, I am not Batman 😝\n\nAlso, I will suggest going through my LinkedIn profile (you will find good content and jokes in it) - https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachinnareshmittal/ <This message was edited>",

    "message": "A Big Thank You 😊\n\nThanks a ton for taking time to fill our Survey Form last week, to tell us your current pain points on gifting-as-a-service in your organization. We only circulated it among our warm contacts and received ~50 responses in 3 days which reconfirms our doubts on broken experience in delighting your employees/clients/partners with gifting!! We are in nascent stages right now and your inputs are largely helping us shape our gifting platform, a warm thank you 😊 For transparency, we attached results of the survey with this write-up.\n\nWe are building Amy Gifting as an online platform specializing in bulk gifting solutions for corporates, SMEs and Start-ups. We aim to provide a seamless experience for businesses looking to streamline and automate their gifting processes, offering a wide range of curated/exclusive/exquisite products, customizable options, and end-to-end trackable logistics. \n\nThoughtful gifts evoke positive emotions in our minds, we strongly believe that!!\n\nWe observed that orgs. spend money on gifting with no measurable success metrics as outcome. We aim to introduce ‘Employee satisfaction score’ as a success metric to report to the gifting org., To do this, we start with collecting feedback (text & video formats) from gift recipients on your behalf. \n\nThis is just one feature, we are sure that we will come up with many more such cool features as we keep executing orders. \n\nIf you are interested to be part of our exciting journey from day 1, and be kind enough to help us from your experience, associate with us by sharing your email here https://forms.gle/eLc68fPdyVtT26Fu8 We will make you part of our close-group of amazing Founders, HR Heads, Function Heads, EAs and Senior Executives. We know the value of your time, so all that we will do is email you 2-3 line pointers on our weekly progress. If you find that we are moving in a wrong direction, correct us, if not, just read and close the email 😊 We are a small and agile team at the moment, who eagerly want to learn and improve from your inputs, and ofcourse you will get your well-deserved perks in the form of discounts when we go live 😊\n\nWrite to us anytime, anyday on anything manasa@amygifting.com",

Have you implemented the necessary measures to ensure compliance? If so, I'd love to hear about your experience with it.\n Could you share any details on how much percentage of the total gratuity liability has been being invested in the gratuity fund?\n Any insights or tips you could share would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to hearing from you!\n😊🫡🙏",

All non-DEI aligned behaviour that I’ve observed in my career stems from the insecurity to surround themselves with similar folks especially in a non-domicile working city (kannadiga in chennai or northie in Bangalore, etc).

I have seen in few orgs, where junior folks are already doing great stakeholder management, employee engagement and many other things which falls under the lead category, but can we give that title? Answer would be possibly no, even if the answer goes yes to some extent, will they be paid at that level, answer - definitely no. One of the junior folk I'm only mentoring, and she is doing amazingly good, and she is already coming to a lead \"as per the framework shared\", but she is not. \n\nI'm not saying it's bad, or not disrespecting the fact from wherever it is coming from. \n\nWhat I meant is these framework needs to be tailor made to suit org needs.

It bridges the gap between your ATS and     LinkedIn \n2. Improves your sourcing productivity by leaps. \n3. Do not waste time: \n- switching between LinkedIn and your ATS, \n- checking if a profile exists in your ATS or not, \n- checking if someone from your team has already reached out to a candidate or not,\n- downloading resumes from LinkedIn and uploading them to your ATS. \n\nTalentTick does it for you by showing the status and details of a candidate on their linkedin profile itself and also lets you add a profile directly from linkedin through a click of a button. \n\nCurrently supports Greenhouse and Ashby, open to adding support for your ATS.\n\nWatch a quick demo: https://youtu.be/CkWrmSwxx6c\n\nRecruiters at Headout are loving it!

Now those candidates who don’t qualify those key skills set, put them to reject section and send the email to them.\n\n3. How do you sift through the inbound profiles?

So a bit time consuming if you are ready to spend time.\n2. Filter works great in ATS like Greenhouse to weed out irrelevant profiles by creating rules while posting a Job. This can also be solved by sending a quick job form manually/automatically at an Application review stage.\n3. The mandatory filter/ questionnaires helps manage pipeline effectively.\n4. ⁠Generally quality of Inbounds are great if  you’ve good market reputation and great social media presence. \nWe have got 70% success with inbounds last year.",

Do add a friction in process like a form to be filled or by linking the platform application and ATS which then auto sifts through these profiles? _I have used Zoho and now Trackstar. None of them are good enough in weeding out irrelevant folks. So manual sifting. You can have a form/intro video like others suggested.

TIme to Productivity - The average time taken from when the position opens till they can match the level of productivity of an employee who's been in the system at a similar level. \n_The last two help you reverse calculate how early you need to start looking for candidates for planned hiring._\n4. Screen to Offer - This is from the time a candidate is screened (in case of outbound search) till they are sent an offer. We try to keep this <7 working days. \n\nMost of our searches are indeed outbound, we search on LinkedIn, pick up numbers from Naukri. \n\nWe use Zoho One, so Zoho People as an HRMS and Zoho Recruit as the ATS. \n\nThe biggest advantage of an ATS which I find is having your own mini database. I remember speaking with the Bigshyft guys when they were quite new, and it's always good to ask who are you not good enough for 😅. They said Amazon is a pain, they already have profiles of every candidate we send them in their database. \n\nWhich brings me to the other point this group is discussing, inbound applications are directly linked with your employer branding, if you are a recognisable brand in the industry, your inbound applications will be enough to close positions else outbound searches and recruitment vendor empanelment is what you'd need.

Initially didn’t stream the event to make it feel exclusive. Started streaming on Twitter & YouTube when crowd started hitting capacity. 2 hrs max (except code retreat was 6 hrs)\n\nDeets - Completely free, all registrations on meetup site or Google form, pizzas for lunch at closure. Budget would be 5-8k per event. On avg 60-80% would turn up. First 3-4 ones we only got about 10 folks to come. Eventually 6 months down the line, 50+ would come which was our limit as we had a small office.\n\nHiring - I made 3 SSE hires from these events + 1 architect on consultant contract.",

R1 is Exploratory call to do basic checks and mutual alignment of skills by one of the interviewer, then R2 Technical round to check Depth of mandatory skills then R3 covers Breadth of overall skills, and final round is cultural fitment or HMs discussion. Now ideally for every 5 candidates who reach Final round 1 should get offer. In worst case 7 anything above that the interview process should be reviewed if assessment is correct. Now for every 5 candidates to reach HM round atleast 7-10 go through Technical rounds. And for those 7-10 technical rounds atleast 12-15 screened and Shortlisted candidates to be lined up. And to get those 12-15 shortlisted candidates you may need to source 20-30 candidates, screen and shortlist top candidates meeting the criteria. Now it may happen that role gets closed in first 3 candidates you line up or in some cases when expectations are high from HMs it can take months to close as well. Good to backtrack and see what usually works for each skills, candidate pool size,  demographics, Quarter in which hiring request are made (Example Candidates are less likely to switch close to appraisals in quarter 4 hence even if people take offers there is high chances they use it to their benefits and negotiate internally) and many other variables.

You can bargain a higher pay while you're in the job while looking for other opportunities. \n\nYou could compromise on money, a bit for a while, but do not compromise on the role. \n\nI say this because it is true that distance MBA candidates are less preferred in the job market, unfortunately, so once you land something focus on performance and upskilling. \n\nI will also say one year gap is nothing, we have returning mothers I have hired in my office after 3-4 years of maternity break and they are thriving.\n\nPatience is going to be key.\nAnd like other community members have said earlier - make a list of things that you learned in your gap year (without sounding too philosophical) and talk about them in the interview. \n\nAlso, DM me your resumé, let me see if I can refer.

Parallel to this, you can run a diversity/ women *Allyship Program* to train the managers of the selected group to also encourage and allow more autonomy among diverse groups and nurture their growth. This would be like a mirror program to the leadership one. \n\nDiversity is not necessarily having representation across various groups, it is also that no matter your background, your skill set is all that matters. This is a generic training that everyone could do as a part of onboarding checklist.",

    "message": "Good morning everyone,\nI am approaching this experienced cohort with a challenge Iam facing. \nOurs is a 10 years old start up company. Till last year we had unlimited leave policy, which means there was no cap on max number of day of leave and likewise we did not have leave encashment or leave carry forward.\n\nAs we are now scaling and we have around 250 employees, our founders decided to implement a cap on leave and introduced a new policy with around 24 days leave including  casual leave and sick leave. As a result, people started asking about leave encashment and leave carry forward. \nThough we have a HRMS where people are supposed to apply for leave to ensure we have a record of leave taken by each employee, the culture is yet to grow and managers are not enforcing application of leave before proceeding on leave. Further, as we have flexible working hours and compensatory offs we dont intend to allow leave encashment or carry forward.\n\nMy queries to you all:\n1.⁠ ⁠Is it mandatory by any law to have leave encashment or leave carry carry forward or is it a company policy matter?\n2.⁠ ⁠If I revert back to unlimited leave policy and if an employee resigns , is he entitled to leave encashment? \n\nLooking forward to your advice folks\nRegards and thanks in advance🙏",

I did Ops, BP, Recruiting, EB for 4 years in a way I made for myself - imperfect but from the ground up. And then I realised I am going to hit a wall soon so I did a 1.5yr course from TISS - they call it SVE  program (school of vocational education: https://sve.tiss.edu/TISS/) and seems it has been rebranded now to something else. But my 2019 course was classroom in gurgaon with coursework and faculty from TISS visiting each weekend (that centre is now closed). This course was eye opening because I was studying with leaders who had handled strikes in manufacturing or handled 10k+ span in mother dairy or something similar. I learnt a lot from people and coursework here, and it helped me a lot in my program work at Unacademy in thinking and executing broadly.",

Many of those issues I had not even envisioned. Half faculty was NUS faculty and other half were CHROs from HP, Schindler etc. I actually got more from this than my TISS course.

    "message": "A good read \nThe typical notice period for tech jobs varies significantly between the US and Europe. In the US, it's common for employees to provide 2-3 weeks of notice, sometimes up to 4 weeks, as a courtesy. This period isn't typically mandated by law, and employees can technically leave their job at any time ¹.\n\nIn contrast, European employment contracts often require a much longer notice period, typically 3 months or more. This extended period is designed to provide employers with sufficient time to find a replacement and ensure a smoother transition. However, it can also limit labor mobility and impact wages ¹.\n\nIt's worth noting that notice periods can vary across European countries. For example, Germany has longer notice periods, while Greece has shorter periods, sometimes as short as 2 weeks ¹. France also has a relatively standard notice period of 30 days, with employees required to pay the employer for each missing day if they fail to provide adequate notice ¹.\n\n*Notice Periods in European Countries:*\n\n- _Germany_: Longer notice periods\n- _Greece_: Shorter notice periods (as short as 2 weeks)\n- _France_: 30 days\n\nOverall, understanding the typical notice periods in the US and Europe can help you navigate the job market and plan your next career move.",

However, if the employee worked even briefly and raises a labor dispute, it could become an issue.\n\nThe best approach is to discuss and resolve the matter amicably with employee as this will be an issue later on for them if there is a background check. If employee agrees, avoid recording the employment details. If the employee insists on salary, ask them to resign formally, serve the notice period as per the probation clause, and process their salary, PF, TDS, etc and issue a relieving letter.",

I often find it challenging to find quality candidate with JS experience and most of the top tier talent in our case for senior dev (in terms of their previous exp and project) have come from python background and have cracked out 3 rounds of tech interviews better than other folks from Java and JS. But we have also been able to find good JS candidates. So can’t say depends on the pool you are getting and the overall candidature than the tech stack solely. \n\nAlso, salary here has nothing to do with the language but rather on the job role and requirement. \n- Say if the dev is required only to do maintenance  work and small fixes then their salary band could be lower than other devs who are building the product or features from scratch and handling the whole software architect, and supervising junior devs. <This message was edited>",

It helps shape culture, attract early believers, and build momentum. But staying involved in every hire till 500? That feels like overkill and honestly a recipe for burnout.\n\nA more scalable approach is:\n- Founder drives hiring till ~30–50,\n- Stays involved in leadership roles till ~100–150,\n- Then shifts focus to building a strong hiring engine with the right people and systems.\n\nFounders should aim to hire people they trust to carry the culture forward, not stay stuck in the loop themselves.

Selling in the first bucket is relatively easier because you only make money if the partner business does (in this case, restaurants listed on DoorDash).\n2. ⁠The general split between base and OTE in commission based roles is 75:25 whereas in subscription selling is closer to 50:50.\n3. ⁠For the subscription based AE roles, the quotas for AEs are generally about 5x of their compensation.

Check how to handle pf with pf office as its legal deductible component.  If employee has maintained home address, emergency contacts person and phone number formally complete all connects save artifacts.  If employee is holding company laptop wait for formal timeline to be completed i think this will require police fir due to data privacy and security.

I have seen a handful of smart recruiters doing 25- 30 now in a quarter to just 10- 15 in a quarter again averaged out. All of this depends on the quality of hire, total hc you plan to hire and in a controlled attrition.  If there is a leaking bucket scenario, no specific number of TA folks would be able to support 😊. Your TA head will need all of this information to arrive at tge ideal team structure too. <This message was edited>",

    "message": "*My 2 cents:*\nGo beyond the pedigree. If you’re open to hiring early career folks (1-2 yrs), look for people at startups similar to your stage or maybe one step ahead. These folks have experienced the ambiguous environment and understand how things work at an early stage. They would also have solved problems from scratch.\nCollect a few basic technical questions from your team and ask candidates these questions at your level of the call. These could also be questions with binary responses. I also often asked my team to give me questions and also hints for how to know if the candidate is giving the answer in the right direction (b’cuz ofcourse these are technical questions, I would look for certain keywords they would use or approach they follow). This definitely reduced the rejections at the next stage.\nKeep one round of technical interviews just for screening. Don’t invest a lot of time here but only max 45 mins where one of your engineers does this round. If the candidate doesn’t seem to be able to move the needle in the first 20-30 min, we would respectfully ask to close the call.",

Essentially, we want to eliminate all those manual pre-interview tasks. Bonus points if it also offers AI-driven analytics for quick, insightful reporting.\nIf you’ve used, or know someone who’s used, an ATS like this, I’d love your recommendations.

When she does report to work, she often signs off early and delegates her responsibilities to others, sometimes without my knowledge. This pattern has continued for the past two months.\n\nWhile I’ve been accommodating so far, it’s starting to affect team productivity and morale. What’s more concerning is that 2-3 other employees have started following the same pattern after observing her behavior.\n\nI’m considering offering her a 10-day medical leave to focus on her health and return with clarity. Alternatively, would it be fair to ask her to resign with a two-month notice period - one month being mandatory and the second flexible if she finds another opportunity?\n\nI understand that asking someone to leave due to health concerns is sensitive and ethically tricky, but the indirect work-shifting and growing ripple effect on the team are now hampering operations.\n\nWould love your input on how best to address this.",

Gen. fresher referrals do not work for payouts. Position Band, Salary range can be equated to arrive at what can be referral bonus. 3) Who is eligible to refer. (Exclude who are under investigation, exit pipeline) 5) You may want to think of unlimited referrals / cap on x no of referrals per employee.  6) For calculation only basic salary range will apply 7) Are referrals bonus payout taxable (get view from payroll team) in reality its yes 8) When will referral bonus payout gets credited; immediately post joining or in the salary cycle. But you should have solution sorted for a possible situation of, if joiner quits before bonus payout!  Trust this helps, let me know.",

For the sales process, broad strokes of what’s evaluated in these rounds:\n- Past performance: what kind of quota/KPIs did they carry? How familiar are they with their funnel conversions? Comfort with CRM and other dashboarding tools. Examples of difficult deals they’ve worked on are discussed and our team has a bit of sales role play to identify how they do discovery, overcome objections, etc.\n2. ⁠In terms of sourcing channels, LinkedIn has worked best (both inbound through job postings and outreach that we do). Response rates for outreach typically range between 30-45% depending on geography. We’ve also tried out some country specific job boards too.\n3. ⁠Generally 3 discussion rounds (recruiter < case study < reporting manager < leadership)\n\nIn terms of learnings, we’ve seen that at least in the context of Headout, folks who have tackled problem statements outside of just pure sales tend to be better fits. <This message was edited>",

KRA mapping, OD interventions.\nRound 3: Culture and stakeholder-fit discussion to gauge communication, influence, and ability to partner with business teams, BU Heads, engaging strategic ESAT etc.\nOptionally, we can involve an external HR advisor for one round to validate depth on compliance, PMS, and process design.
