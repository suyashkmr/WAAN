Saturday, June 29 | 9.00 AM | Brigade Road - MG Road

Join me and 14 other fellow Bengaluru heritage enthusiasts as we explore the rich history of the iconic stretch of Bangalore.

27/06/24, 22:55 - Dinesh Camera Traveller Heritage Walk: Alright! These structures are called Kempegowda watch towers, adapted by the city municipal body in recognition of the city's founder.
Built by Kempe Gowda I, These four watch towers marked the boundary of the city which has now way grown beyond those boundaries. If you're around Lal Bagh, Mekhri Circle, Gavipuram, or Ulsoor, do stop by to witness the history unfold. Also, today marks the mighty Kempe Gowda's Birthday!
28/06/24, 14:10 - Suyash: So small correction. The towers were built by Kempegowda I's successor, Immadi Kempegowda alias Kempegowda II
28/06/24, 14:11 - Suyash: The towers were built in 1597
Kempegowda 1 passed away in 1569

03/07/24, 22:23 - Anusha YD: I'm thinking Juggernaut is of British origin and the rest had some Asian/eastern ties.. atleast from what I read of the world' meaning

03/07/24, 23:06 - Kiranmayi Kalepalli Senior Recruiter Capgemini: Hmmm 🧐
03/07/24, 23:07 - Self Community: The most commonly accepted one is that the origin is _kichap_, a Malay word
03/07/24, 23:08 - Self Community: Which was a fish sauce
03/07/24, 23:08 - Self Community: But there's also an alternative origin which comes from Karnataka

08/07/24, 11:17 - Self Community: Initiated in 1802, The Great Trigonometrical Survey (GTS) was a monumental project undertaken by the Survey of India.
08/07/24, 11:18 - Self Community: Its primary objective was to measure the entire Indian subcontinent with scientific precision.
08/07/24, 11:18 - Self Community: This survey played a critical role in the development of modern cartography, geodesy, and contributed significantly to the understanding of the Earth's shape and dimensions.
08/07/24, 11:19 - Self Community: One of the countless outcomes was the naming of Mt. Everest and the measurement of its height leading to its recognition as the highest peak on the planet
08/07/24, 11:19 - Self Community: Before this, it was known as Peak XV
08/07/24, 11:20 - Self Community: Living in Bangalore, some of you may recognise that the VC firm Sequoia India chose to rename itself as Peak XV partners. This is the origin of the name
08/07/24, 11:21 - Self Community: But the reason I brought up GTS is even closer to home
08/07/24, 11:26 - Self Community: GTS required the establishment of baselines at various locations throughout the country
08/07/24, 11:27 - Self Community: A baseline is a permanently fixed reference survey station or point, having known elevation with respect to mean sea level
08/07/24, 11:32 - Self Community: Te first baseline was drawn between KR Puram and Agara but it was then abandoned due to a technical error
08/07/24, 11:36 - Self Community: Later, a new baseline was established in Bangalore <This message was edited>
08/07/24, 11:37 - Self Community: This also included 9 benchmark points and observatories

23/07/24, 17:31 - Arundhati Raaj Bengaluritage: Big and warm hello to everyone in here! 

I am Arundhati; I am quite new to Bengaluru and I am exploring ways to connect with this new city and establish newer human connections. I love walks -- be it of heritage, food, poetry, botany -- it is my way to embrace the hollowness of existence. Though an extremely lazy texter,  and selectively introverted, I am as curious as a cat when it comes to trying new community engagements.
23/07/24, 17:32 - Suyash: Thank you for joining us Arundhati
23/07/24, 17:32 - Arundhati Raaj Bengaluritage: My pleasure :)
23/07/24, 17:33 - Suyash: What's your hometown Arundhati?
23/07/24, 17:35 - Arundhati Raaj Bengaluritage: I am a Malayali from Malabar. But my family lives in Vadodara, Gujarat. I was living in Delhi for the past 5-6 years. So, I am in an eternal dilemma about where exactly is my home and hometown.
23/07/24, 17:35 - Anand Murthy Bengaluritage: I stay at ulsoor
23/07/24, 17:35 - Suyash: I hear you. I have found myself in similar predicament.
23/07/24, 17:36 - Suyash: Ah nice. Ever got the chance and permission to visit the Madras Sappers museum there?
23/07/24, 17:37 - Arundhati Raaj Bengaluritage: One small thing, maybe. 

It is originally called/known as 'Malleshwara' (not Malleshwaram), after Lord Malleswara. I heard that old Bengaluru folks still conservatively prefer Malleswara over Malleswaram.
23/07/24, 17:38 - Suyash: Yes, we actually discussed this very thing sometime back here in the group
23/07/24, 17:38 - Arundhati Raaj Bengaluritage: Ok!
23/07/24, 17:39 - Suyash: It's named after the Kadu Malleswara temple
23/07/24, 17:39 - Arundhati Raaj Bengaluritage: Yes.
23/07/24, 17:40 - Suyash: It was built in the 17th century by Venkoji, Shivaji's brother <This message was edited>

OPTION: No (2 votes)

04/09/24, 21:07 - Chandeep Bengaluritage Walk: Possibility of a book reading session? or discussion about it perhaps @⁨Suyash⁩ ?
04/09/24, 21:07 - Suyash: Will definitely try
04/09/24, 21:08 - Suyash: But the reason for this question is that there's a character in one of the stories linked to Bangalore
04/09/24, 21:08 - Suyash: Anyone remembers a character called Col. Sebastian Moran?
04/09/24, 21:09 - Suyash: He was 2nd in command to Moriarty. In the story, Holmes described him as the 2nd most dangerous man after Moriarty
04/09/24, 21:10 - Suyash: Anyone remember this?
04/09/24, 21:11 - Chandeep Bengaluritage Walk: Read adventure of empty house few years back. I think he's the main antagonist of that part

04/09/24, 21:31 - Suyash: The reason I was reminded of this was because I recently watched this new series called Shekhar Home,  which the 1st Indian adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. If you're a Holmes fan, I highly recommend it

Those who're new to Bangalore, are you familiar with Onam Sadya?
OPTION: Yes 🤤 (7 votes)
OPTION: Nonam (5 votes)

12/09/24, 18:02 - Suyash: Ok so Onam is an annual harvest festival celebrated in Kerala.
12/09/24, 18:03 - Suyash: Lasts 4 days
12/09/24, 18:03 - Suyash: For fellow Northies, Onam is as big in Kerala as Diwali is up North, if not more
12/09/24, 18:04 - Suyash: And what I personally love about it is that though the origins are in Hindi mythology, it has become Kerala's state festival with all religions celebrating it with equal gusto
12/09/24, 18:04 - Suyash: Sadya is the traditional meal that's prepared at this time
12/09/24, 18:05 - Suyash: It's typically a vegetarian affair and a typical sadya includes 24-30 dishes serves on banana leaf
12/09/24, 18:06 - Suyash: Some restaurants serve the most amazing Sadya in Bangalore
12/09/24, 18:06 - Suyash: So I would highly recommend that you explore where good Sadya is being served near you and book a table for this Sunday, Sep 15
12/09/24, 18:07 - Suyash: Usually costs around 1000-1800 /head depending on the place. Takeaway is a bit cheaper than dine-in <This message was edited>
12/09/24, 18:08 - Suyash: For Koramangala folks, some good options are:
1. Moplah's
2. Kappa Chakka Kandari
3. Indian Coffee House
12/09/24, 18:08 - Suyash: Indiranagar:
Coracle cafe in BIC are serving
12/09/24, 18:09 - Suyash: There are many places in every locality which provide this so explore and book a place or takeout in advance as these slots runs out very quickly <This message was edited>
12/09/24, 18:10 - Suyash: And be prepared for a major food coma post the meal

12/09/24, 18:10 - Aadhya Shah Bengaluritage: Indiranagar also has Salt Mango Tree
12/09/24, 18:12 - Suyash: Most of these places usually list date, timing, price and booking link on their Instagram so that could be a good place to start
12/09/24, 18:12 - Suyash: I'll also share links that I come across

Officially retired now, so trying new avenues, and here because of the experience last Saturday where Suyash regaled us all with stories of the most iconic part of the city and its treasures that continue to fascinate, despite the buildings themselves having transformed, pulled down or boarded up over the last 100 years
20/09/24, 12:02 - Shweta Bengaluritage 1%: Hello everyone,
Thankyou Suyash for making me a part of Bengaluritage.

20/09/24, 13:08 - Jayanthi Manjunath Bengaluritage 1%: Hello everyone, myself Jayanthi and very much interested in exploring places since I would like to pass on the information to my kids or younger generation.

Looking forward for more such meets n informations.

29/09/24, 17:40 - Suyash: Officials' apathy is always disappointing but so not surprising
29/09/24, 17:43 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: It's mostly incompetence in most cases, followed by knee-jerk reaction to a mishap, IMHO

14/10/24, 15:34 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: I took the lazy way out

14/10/24, 15:35 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Oldest Durga Puja at Bengali Club Kashmere Gate
14/10/24, 15:36 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: When women, old and young, in sarees, outnumber men while riding the escalator at metro station, you correctly conclude that it is festival time. And not just any regular festival, but the Durga Puja. 
On the auspicious day of Navami, I went Pandal hopping, from the oldest Durga Puja at the Bengali Club, to many others in the region of CR Park, Kali Bari and Rama Krishna Ashram. 
The traditional dress discipline followed by the elders in form of bright and flowy sarees of women, and simply embroidered bengali kurtas has been turned on its head by the woke generation. The fairer sex wore pastel shades, with elegant ethnic and geometric patterns and understated jewellery, the men adorned rather garish, dazzling, scintillating, irridescent, sequined kurtas of varying length and material, from see-through crocheted to heavily ornate shades of royal blue, blood red, magenta and even shocking pink.
Other than this glaring reversal, what was on display?
The show of hands, that went up in the air as purohits chanted the mantras, not with devotion, but to click the photographs at the right moment.
Tradition isn't what it used to be, or may be it is. 
Who cares!
Enjoy the festival!!!
14/10/24, 15:36 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: My observation of the various spots
14/10/24, 15:44 - Suyash: Love it
14/10/24, 16:06 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Thank you
14/10/24, 16:07 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: The high point was watching five theatrical productions in Delhi, including a Ramleela that is now in its 68th year

14/10/24, 16:23 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: If it offers any solace, I have come here after more than a year, and will return to Namma Bengaluru tomorrow
14/10/24, 16:29 - Suyash: I haven't been to Delhi in years
14/10/24, 16:34 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: I cut my teeth into theatre and heritage only in Delhi, and built strong friendships during the two years I spent here, pre Covid. So despite the pollution, and despite the chaos on the roads, Delhi remains the city of my heart, and I try to visit each year
14/10/24, 20:23 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: dope pictures 😇 @⁨Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage⁩
14/10/24, 20:23 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: I always get a high here😝
14/10/24, 23:01 - Anusha YD: Woww.. love how you put it!
14/10/24, 23:11 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Thank you, but this was all that was discernible. Fashion and food seemed to be on everyone's mind. Even my hardcore Bengali friend was more interested in the Bhog, and when he didn't find his desired dish he left unceremoniously! Devotion needed to be searched with a hand lens.

We don't know who the owner is, and if we just untie it, they may accuse us of stealing

15/10/24, 16:23 - Esther Raj Premaka Bengaluritage Walk: I don't have Facebook, so I'd be grateful if someone could help me with that

23/10/24, 14:01 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Hi All,

Thanks to Suyash for adding me here.

I am Sunil Pichamuthu here.
A 4th generation Bangalorean and IT professional
My Bangalorean background in brief:
My great grandfather was the first Indian Headmaster of Wesleyan Mission School where Sir Mirza Ismail was one of his students.
My grandfather was Dr. C. S. Pichamuthu a geologist who scientifically proved that parts of then Mysore State was formed under the sea.
My father is Dr. J P Pichamuthu who developed the indigenous runway visual range assessment system for airports called AVRA now branded as Drishti.

I had presented a plan to the BBMP on tunnel roads in 1999-2000 after approaching the then CM S M Krishna.
An article on tunnel roads was published in the The Hindu on 28 January 2001.

I used to actively blog at https://sunilpichamuthu.blogspot.com 

I am also interested in Bangalore history and have written two booklets on the history of St. Mark's Cathedral on MG Road and also conducted a history walk around that church.
23/10/24, 14:08 - Suyash: Welcome to Bengaluritage Sunil. Wonder to have you among us
23/10/24, 14:09 - Suyash: Where can we get our hands on your booklets?
Also, do share the Hindu article also?

23/10/24, 14:15 - Suyash: Would love to attend
23/10/24, 14:15 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Surely
23/10/24, 14:36 - Suyash: Folks,

23/10/24, 14:40 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: I have been on all but one walk circuits with Mansoor, and the experience each time has been Wow-worthy!

25/10/24, 11:38 - Suyash: I'm going for this too this weekend. This is the 1st instance of something heritage related from my hometown in Bengaluru that I'm aware of so I'm excited
25/10/24, 11:41 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Interesting an old Bangalorean I know is settled down in the Doon area I guess.. Kathgodam
25/10/24, 11:44 - Aadhya Shah Bengaluritage: Saw this too today and agenda and three days are super packed with exciting things!
25/10/24, 12:37 - Suyash: Oh nice. Kathgodam is actually in Nainital area. Doon is Dehradun
25/10/24, 12:37 - Suyash: They're about a 7-8 hour drive apart

29/10/24, 21:33 - Suyash: Today my birthplace i.e. Agra, lost the last remaining monument credited to Mumtaz Mahal, to disrepair
29/10/24, 21:34 - Suyash: This was the corner Burj of Jahanara Bagh
29/10/24, 21:34 - Suyash: Pic 1 and Pic 3 are before pictures
29/10/24, 21:34 - Suyash: Pic 2 and Pic 4 are after
29/10/24, 21:34 - Suyash: Pains me so much, it's tough to express in words
29/10/24, 21:35 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Deliberate neglect, not just apathy
29/10/24, 21:37 - Suyash: This should be outright criminal
29/10/24, 21:37 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: It absolutely is
29/10/24, 21:37 - Suyash: But we live in a country where most educated people still don't give a flying f*** about our history and heritage
29/10/24, 21:39 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: People don't care, some won't, many can't afford to
29/10/24, 21:39 - Suyash: I really don't expect anyone to be obsessive about history like me. But even basic respect for history is too much to ask
29/10/24, 21:39 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Agra is my ancestral place too, and the people are the reason why I absolutely abhor going there
29/10/24, 21:40 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: It's also looking like active damage was given to both places
29/10/24, 21:40 - Suyash: It's my native place too and I know exactly what you're talking about
29/10/24, 21:40 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Heritage is kept alive bh the people around it, not by government. ASI doesn't have the budget or the gumption
29/10/24, 21:41 - Suyash: Absolutely possible. When there's no protection, people often tend to chup away material or take away bricks to reuse in personal construction and repairs
29/10/24, 21:41 - Suyash: Yup
29/10/24, 21:42 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Agra,as per SM Latif 's book had 300 mansions on the river bank, not one stands today
29/10/24, 21:42 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Happened to the bricks from indus valley civilisation. We are the land of vandals
29/10/24, 21:43 - Suyash: Correct. Most locals aren't aware of the local monuments outside of Taj, Agra fort, Sikandra and maybe Itmad-ud-daula
29/10/24, 21:44 - Suyash: Been happening for centuries. It's just so frustrating that it continues in the 21st century, in a city which literally houses a wonder of the world
29/10/24, 21:45 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Locals are obsessed with themselves and everyone around them, it will require brain transplantation into them to become aware of important things in life
29/10/24, 21:46 - Suyash: Lol
29/10/24, 21:46 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: And frankly, about some monuments I am actually happy that they are blissfully ignorant, e.g. jhunjhun katora in the court complex, the cemetery opposite it
29/10/24, 21:46 - Suyash: So true. I feel the same about the Roman Catholic Cemetery, Chini ka rauza, etc. there
29/10/24, 21:47 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Red Tajmahal, Samru's grave are really resting there while chaos prevails metres away from them <This message was edited>
29/10/24, 21:48 - Suyash: Yup yup
29/10/24, 21:50 - Suyash: <Media omitted>
29/10/24, 21:52 - Suyash: It's the tomb of Col John William Hessing, built by his wife at Agra's Roman Catholic Cemetery in 1803 after he died in a military engagement.
29/10/24, 21:52 - Suyash: He was a mercenary and was serving the Marathas who ruled Agra at the time of his death
29/10/24, 21:52 - Suyash: But this cemetery is a wonder in itself.
29/10/24, 21:53 - Suyash: It's one of the oldest Christian cemeteries in North India
29/10/24, 21:53 - Suyash: 400+ years old
29/10/24, 21:54 - Suyash: Started off as an Armenian Christian Cemetery
29/10/24, 21:55 - Suyash: <Media omitted>
29/10/24, 21:55 - Suyash: If I remember correctly, the oldest grave is from 1550
29/10/24, 21:56 - Suyash: There's even this one grave which states that the person met Akbar in his court
29/10/24, 21:57 - Suyash: <Media omitted>

29/10/24, 22:01 - Suyash: Oh and credits to Heritage Hindustan for the 4 pics of the minaret
29/10/24, 22:03 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: It looks like Islamic architecture even though it's a tomb of Christians
29/10/24, 22:03 - Suyash: It was meant to be a red sandstone imitation of Taj
29/10/24, 22:03 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: <Media omitted>
29/10/24, 22:03 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: This reminded me of this  fact I recently learnt - earlier, Christian prayers used to be similar to Muslim prayer (bowing head and touching to ground) -

29/10/24, 22:04 - Suyash: Noice! Thanks for sharing
29/10/24, 22:04 - Suyash: Super interesting
29/10/24, 22:04 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Mrs Hessing chose this design for the final resting place of her valiant husband
29/10/24, 22:06 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Not much is documented about it, but it is believed to have been built by Humayun to honour the water carrier who saved his life . The name is attributed to the tinkling sound that heralded the arrival of bhishtis (water carriers) and its dome resembling an inverted bowl

That's a long-ass food coma
25/11/24, 12:41 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: Pizza (they fortunately gave an option to serve two pizzas half-half) and Chicken Karaage
25/11/24, 12:41 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: This latter is a "small plate" as per their menu but was quite big in portion size
25/11/24, 12:48 - Bean Bengaluritage: After seeing what he ate, I understand haha
25/11/24, 12:49 - Bean Bengaluritage: Did you eat the tiramisu? The first time I ate it, I was like meh whatever, the second time I was absolutely mindblown
25/11/24, 12:49 - Tanya Pal Bengaluritage: How was the pizza?! Never tried at Lupa!
25/11/24, 12:49 - Bean Bengaluritage: need to eat it a third time to see whenever it was me or their consistency (excuse to go eat it again)
25/11/24, 13:02 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: No
25/11/24, 13:02 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: Very fresh, couldn't recommend it enough

25/11/24, 18:50 - Suyash: Folks, Arun Pai is the founder of BangaloreWalks, the first org I know dedicated to heritage walks in the city, started some 15 years ago
25/11/24, 18:50 - Suyash: Walks with Arun Pai aren't very common anymore since one of their key team members unfortunately passed away last year
25/11/24, 18:51 - Suyash: Highly recommend this if you're into walks like mine
25/11/24, 18:51 - Vani Subramaniam Heritage Walk: Yep :(

Fully thinking of retiring from work during the days hubba is on
25/11/24, 18:51 - Vani Subramaniam Heritage Walk: Soooo much to do
25/11/24, 18:53 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: I am also struggling on those weekdays between work, home responsibilities and Bangalore Walks...
25/11/24, 18:55 - Suyash: Who needs employment anyway
26/11/24, 15:23 - Suyash: Folks we have a quizzing group also here

29/11/24, 10:27 - Bean Bengaluritage: I love looking at the old adverts
29/11/24, 10:28 - Bean Bengaluritage: used to sit in the archives at my first job just looking at the old ads haha
29/11/24, 10:42 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Wow, you must have been through the legendary ads that I saw growing up. I am still haunted by the memories of Persis Khambatta's expressions in Garden Vareli ads.
29/11/24, 11:04 - Bean Bengaluritage: The place I worked at had been publishing since 1946 - and that and the 50s were my favourite era for ads
29/11/24, 11:04 - Bean Bengaluritage: as in the late 40s and the 50s!
29/11/24, 11:21 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Wow! You really sat on a treasure trove!

29/11/24, 18:59 - Ankur Kayesth Masai: This is really cool!
29/11/24, 20:06 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: This is brilliant! I'm looking at the areas I grew up in and in the 1940s map that area does not even exist 😅

Only see it from 1960 map onwards, that too without the exact name being there. It's only in the 1980 map that the area "Vidyaranyapura" gets mentioned.
29/11/24, 20:07 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Some of the stone/mud quarry that gets mentioned in the map still exist. 😅
29/11/24, 20:10 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: Vanganahalli being today's HSR Layout (some locations on Google Maps even today say Vanganahalli, HSR Layout when you look for them)
30/11/24, 07:52 - Pallavi T Sr. TA Specialist Leap: In case someone is interested in design and culture.

08/12/24, 14:07 - Aadhya Shah Bengaluritage: This is so sad. I have such memories of this place. I wonder what agenda thr govt is pushing by demolishing these british era structures. History isnt just about colonialism I dont think. For some of us there are memories in these buildings, no matter who made them in the first place
08/12/24, 14:08 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Diabolical, not just tragic

Announcing my last Brigade-MG Road walk of 2024.
10/12/24, 13:18 - Suyash: If you enjoyed  my walk, please do share it with your friends
10/12/24, 13:18 - Suyash: If you haven’t attended yet, how about you check this one off your bucketlist for this year?

10/12/24, 13:19 - Suyash: I’m also sharing a forwardable message
10/12/24, 13:25 - Suyash: Bengaluru trivia - India's 1st KFC opened in Bengaluru's Brigade Road in June 1995.
But the site it came to occupy has an even more fascinating story going back to the 1960s.

This is one of the many stories you will learn of the Brigade-MG Road stretch, if you join the last Bengaluritage walk of 2024. Register now before spots run out: https://dhvo.short.gy/BengaluritageMG
10/12/24, 13:25 - Suyash: Please do spread the word. I’d be grateful

11/12/24, 14:21 - Dinesh Camera Traveller Heritage Walk: can help, pls DM
12/12/24, 18:36 - Suyash: Inspired by Arun Pai ( Bangalore Walks⁩ ) I am planning to do a KYC (Know Your Church) walk on 22nd Dec Sunday starting at 9AM from Garuda Mall and visiting 10 to 12 churches in the central areas and see the Christmas decorations.
Will share tidbits of history that I have researched.

13/12/24, 14:19 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: One problem I am facing with Darshini food is I found cooks add jaggery in sambhar
13/12/24, 14:19 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: Is there any chain known by members here wherein the sambhar is spicy?
13/12/24, 14:20 - Suyash: Yes, that's Bangalore sambhar
13/12/24, 14:20 - Suyash: But there are places which have the non-jaggery kind
13/12/24, 14:20 - Suyash: Eg. Konark Residency Road and Konark Kanteerava
13/12/24, 14:20 - Vani Subramaniam Heritage Walk: Hahaha 
I was LITERALLY five seconds back swearing my loyalty to the 'sweet sambar'
13/12/24, 14:20 - Vani Subramaniam Heritage Walk: With a friend
13/12/24, 14:20 - Suyash: I'm a fan too
13/12/24, 14:21 - Vani Subramaniam Heritage Walk: Yessss
Thank you 🤣💯
13/12/24, 14:21 - Priyank Singh Bengaluritage: I am team saagu now 😜
13/12/24, 14:27 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Same plight ! That's why I have almost stopped having sambar at most of the darshinis.
13/12/24, 14:28 - Gaurav Manipal: Try Sambhar at Sendhoor outlets
13/12/24, 14:28 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: And I am blessed with dirty looks each time I politely decline sambar and seek additional chutney
13/12/24, 14:28 - Suyash: Yes they have khatta sambhar too
13/12/24, 14:28 - Gaurav Manipal: Tamilian kind with lots of veggies
13/12/24, 14:28 - Suyash: To be fair, many OG places only give Chutney with Dosa
13/12/24, 14:29 - Vani Subramaniam Heritage Walk: <Media omitted>
13/12/24, 14:29 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: And I actively plan my gustatory pursuits at such places
13/12/24, 14:30 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Right now traveling to Kolhapur, psyching my taste buds for the fiery assault
13/12/24, 14:31 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Time for the extinguisher would be later, right now only fireproofing 😜
13/12/24, 14:34 - Suyash: Lol
13/12/24, 14:41 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: I just keep a cube of butter handy, works like a miracle on capsaicin
13/12/24, 14:43 - Suyash: Nice!
13/12/24, 14:45 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Nani's nuskha
13/12/24, 14:48 - Suyash: With a doctor's insight
13/12/24, 14:50 - Gaurav Manipal: not necessary if nani says: “Butter negates capsaicin” 🤓
13/12/24, 14:51 - Suyash: Bhai Rajat is a doctor. That's what I was acknowledging 😆
13/12/24, 14:51 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Nani knew no capsaicin.
13/12/24, 14:51 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: But it gave me a chance for alliteration 😜
13/12/24, 14:52 - Gaurav Manipal: then from now onwards all nani nuskhes to be verified by Rajat
13/12/24, 14:53 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Nuskha *Nani yaad  dila dega*

16/12/24, 09:37 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Boy!!! You are in a morbid mood indeed! Manic Monday?
16/12/24, 10:54 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Morbid Monday news- Heritage Beku has reported about the crown missing from Queen Victoria statue
16/12/24, 10:57 - Suyash: Yes, saw it. Just sad
16/12/24, 11:22 - Anusha YD: Can you share the article link? Not able to find it, did a generic search
16/12/24, 11:22 - Suyash: https://www.instagram.com/p/DDoGc6gS2gO/?igsh=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==
16/12/24, 11:58 - Akhil Reddy C M Bengaluritage: I was nearby and visited the place, it's a old statue almost 150+ years old.

Both statue and crown are not made up of single stone.

If you see in bare eyes you can see a small pin like thing on Queen's head which was holding the crown.

16/01/25, 18:58 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Parade Cafe started initially on Brigade Road along with Parade Stores. There was a problem with workers salaries and that maybe the time when it changed hands
17/01/25, 17:24 - Suyash: Who can tell me why Koshy's was called Parade Cafe?
17/01/25, 17:35 - Arun Bharadwaj Bengaluritage: MG Road was called South Parade.. Maybe some connection with that..
17/01/25, 17:45 - Suyash: That's exactly right
17/01/25, 17:45 - Suyash: Parade cafe because it was just next to South Parade
19/01/25, 08:41 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Those coming please come by 10AM to the starting point and carry umbrellas and dress approriately.

Enroute there maybe dynamic changes of route based on weather conditions and road/ pavement conditions

19/01/25, 20:14 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: It was cold 
It was crazy
It was wet
It was slushy
Yet....
It was cool
It was soothing 
It was calming
While the weather pulled out all stops to soak, drench and drag us, the inspired leader and obsessive walkers overcame it, through shared experience over valued treasures of the city. Sunil's soft spoken words were as well researched as one expects from him,and needless to say, the day was uplifting, almost levitating. My 30k steps were the happiest ones in Namma Bengaluru so far.
Kudos Sunil! KYC is the latest toast to the town we have all come to love 🥁 🥁🥳
19/01/25, 20:42 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: You did miss a bit.. A visit to the only war memorial in a school here
19/01/25, 20:47 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: That's the sad bit, but I was committed to meeting a friend who is recovering from a stroke. Will join for this portion when you promise to KYCk us again <This message was edited>
19/01/25, 20:58 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: It is tough for stroke and nerve conditions. 
I like the term KYCk..
19/01/25, 21:00 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: He had a congenital heart disease, operated in childhood, so the risk of stroke was always there.  The recovery is good, because of the quick response by the family and consequent timely intervention.
19/01/25, 21:04 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: You can patent the term *KYCk* for Brand Sunil

20/01/25, 18:32 - Suyash: Question from @⁨Ankur Kayesth Masai⁩ 

Hi all, can anyone recommend a high quality sleeping bag for an adult?
To be used in north India, during winters.
Price is a secondary consideration to quality.
20/01/25, 18:33 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: He can take mine
20/01/25, 18:34 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Bought in Feb 2022, used only once
20/01/25, 18:39 - Raksha Nagaraj: I have sleeping bags from North Face and  Kathmandu, very high quality <This message was edited>
20/01/25, 18:46 - Ankur Kayesth Masai: Hey, that's very thoughtful. However I need it for someone in my family, they are based in Goa
20/01/25, 18:46 - Ankur Kayesth Masai: If possible, can you DM the product link(s)?
20/01/25, 19:00 - Raksha Nagaraj: Sure, will send you in sometime

22/01/25, 20:35 - Lilla Gourley Bengaluritage Walk: Church Street would likely take a week or two 🙂

04/02/25, 15:29 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: Wow!That was indeed inexpensive, compared to the back breaking and bank emptying charges applied now. 
But my monthly school fee was Rs 800-900 through early 1990s, std 9-12, in Lucknow. Bangalore was far more economical those days !
04/02/25, 15:31 - Rajat Kulshrestha Bengaluritage: The nostalgia must be intense! It takes some dedication to preserve these memories of the past

10/02/25, 13:07 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Am looking for a worldwide timeline chart listing in parallel the various dynasties across the world
10/02/25, 13:07 - Suyash: ChatGPT maybe able to help generate one?
10/02/25, 13:08 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Good idea. Haven't tried that

10/02/25, 13:13 - Tanya Pal Bengaluritage: I spend way too much time on history youtube 😅

10/02/25, 13:15 - Bean Bengaluritage: I don't know how accurate this will be ultimately
10/02/25, 13:15 - Bean Bengaluritage: it's a very difficult endeavour
10/02/25, 13:15 - Bean Bengaluritage: as dating is one of the trickier subjects in World History
10/02/25, 13:16 - Tanya Pal Bengaluritage: Isn't it also tricky when it comes to indigenous concepts of "the ruling class" and "dynasties". Like pre-colonial leaders of the north and south america, Africa, the laplands, etc?! <This message was edited>
10/02/25, 13:17 - Suyash: Certainly very nuanced when you take that into consideration
10/02/25, 13:19 - Bean Bengaluritage: Yes, and concepts of when history "begins" in various cultures has a bias towards cultures where the writing is readable or where those cultures are trading partners with cultures that have readable scripts
10/02/25, 13:21 - Bean Bengaluritage: BTW, I missed the anniversary but last year marked a 100 years since the announcement that IVC culture was discovered and dated:

11/02/25, 15:39 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Yes. There was a chapel called Drummers Chapel in the Fort Area but it was demolished to accommodate Vani Vilas Hospital and St. Luke's was established later
11/02/25, 15:40 - Suyash: What about St. Mary's Shivajinagar?
11/02/25, 15:44 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: That was established later
11/02/25, 15:44 - Suyash: Thank you @⁨Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage⁩ 🙏🏻
11/02/25, 15:44 - Suyash: No one better than you to ask this

11/02/25, 15:45 - Dinesh Camera Traveller Heritage Walk: currently, the oldest is the Viveknagar one?
11/02/25, 15:49 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: No. Infant Jesus is 1960s in Austin Town
11/02/25, 15:50 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Austin incidentally was also the maiden name of Pamela Austin-Plowden who was the flame of Winston Churchill
11/02/25, 15:50 - Suyash: I unfortunately have not been in town or have had some event at the time of your walks lately. Otherwise I wouldn't miss them for the life of me
11/02/25, 15:51 - Suyash: St Mark's da

23/02/25, 13:20 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: Welcome. Just to stir the confused mixture some more..

Sombu in tamil is aniseed.. so it could be connected to the preparation in which aniseed is added...

Also chombhu is basically a pot.. so it could also be relating to the pot in which its boiled..

So sombur could have so many roots.. 😉

23/02/25, 21:03 - Bean Bengaluritage: It’s obvious that chillies had a transformative influence on indian food and most definitely on whatever proto sambar was
23/02/25, 21:03 - Bean Bengaluritage: So it needs some deeper research to understand
23/02/25, 21:03 - Bean Bengaluritage: Perhaps at least interviewing an anthropologist working in the food history space

24/02/25, 13:55 - Bean Bengaluritage: This is such an exciting discovery especially because the site lay unexcavated for so long since the last one - you would assume that there wasn't going to be of much value. Of course, these days there are much better survey tools available (and it is much cheaper too) so I can understand why they took a risk and it paid off so well
24/02/25, 14:22 - Sunil Pichamuthu Bengaluritage: In UK they leverage tools to do like a digital x-ray of the land.

09/06/25, 13:50 - Akhil Reddy C M Bengaluritage: *You’re Invited: Walk through the Bangalore Cantonment - The Army Town and listen to its tales!*

Join us for a specially curated walk through the heart of Bangalore’s colonial past. This experience will uncover the city’s military roots, the rise of the finest Cantonment and the life within it.

One of our hosts, a philatelist and an Indian military history enthusiast offers an interesting overview into Bangalore’s military culture.

We’ll walk through one of India’s most significant and finest Cantonment. A posting at Bangalore was highly sought after by the British officers .

📅 When? 14 June 2025 at 7:30 AM
📍 Where? MG Road (exact location will be shared after registration)
💰 How much? ₹2500 per person
Includes: Expert-led walk, breakfast at The Ceylon Tea Room, refreshment, souvenir, and more!

On this trail, we’ll explore the “why” and “how” Bangalore was chosen as a Cantonment town, and how it quickly rose to become a celebrated military hub in the country.

This is not just a walk. It’s a deep dive into stories, structures, and timelines that shaped a very unique part of Bangalore.

Together, we will:
•	Trace the evolution of the Cantonment, from its early barracks to today’s MG Road
•	Walk past heritage buildings and former landmarks that shaped this neighbourhood
•	Explore rare archival photographs, maps, postcards, and 19th-century letters
•	Learn about postal, food, and beverage history that reveals how people lived then
•	Connect the dots between the past and present with narratives that bring it all alive

We begin our walk on MG Road, followed by breakfast at a restaurant with a story and a view, then continue onward to Cubbon Road and beyond.

If you enjoy discovering Bangalore in ways that few get to see — this is for you.

DM +918088465996 (Raksha) or +919480940481 (Varun) to secure your spot!

See you on the trail!

10/10/25, 10:10 - Chhaya Bhatt Whitefield Walk: What is this about?
10/10/25, 10:11 - Suyash: Travelling Plants is a transdisciplinary project initiated by the Goethe-Institut Chennai, in collaboration with the Alliance Française of Madras and the Institut Français de Pondichéry. The Exhibition, comprising four artistic positions, curated by Lina Vincent, journeyed through Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, New Delhi, and Colombo, enhanced by fresh local input at each station.
10/10/25, 10:13 - Suyash: Bangalore itself is a living archive of plant migration.

The Charbagh of Lalbagh, envisioned by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, once echoed the gardens of Persia.

The British seeded the city with exotic species, seeking shade and ornament, while the German horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel and others imagined horticultural futures that still unfold today.

In this Exhibition, the artists curated by Suresh Jayaram follow the echoes of these botanical journeys, exploring stories of migration and memory, displacement and resilience. Plants here are protagonists and keepers of histories, witnesses to exchange, exploration and exploitation.
